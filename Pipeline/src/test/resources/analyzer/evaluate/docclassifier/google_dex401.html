bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of

additional Securities shall be issued under a separate CUSIP number unless: (i)&nbsp;the additional Securities and the outstanding notes of the original series are treated as part of the same &#147;issue&#148; of debt instruments for U.S. federal
income tax purposes; (ii)&nbsp;the additional Securities are issued pursuant to a &#147;qualified reopening&#148; of the outstanding notes of the original series for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (iii)&nbsp;the additional Securities are, and
