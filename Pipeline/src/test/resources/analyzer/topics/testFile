00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_464	101	On December 1, 2011, SNI completed the sale of $500 million of aggregate principal amount Senior Notes. The Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2016 bearing interest at 2.70%. Beginning on June 15, 2012, interest will be paid on the notes on June 15th and December 15th of each year. The proceeds from the offering will be utilized for general corporate purposes which could include strategic acquisitions, repurchases of the company’s common equity, working capital and capital expenditures, and proceeds were used for the repayment of the outstanding principal amount under our Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_465	101	On December 15, 2009, a majority-owned subsidiary of SNI issued a total of $885 million of aggregate principal amount Senior Notes through a private placement. The Senior Notes mature on January 15, 2015 bearing interest at 3.55%. Beginning on July 15, 2010, interest will be paid on the notes on January 15th and July 15th of each year. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by SNI. Cox has agreed to indemnify SNI for payments made in respect of SNI’s guarantee. Substantially all of the proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were distributed to Cox in connection with the Travel Channel Acquisition.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_466	101	We have a Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility (the "Facility") that permits $550 million in aggregate borrowings and expires in June 2014. The Facility bears interest based on the Company’s credit ratings, with drawn amounts bearing interest at Libor plus 175 basis points and undrawn amounts bearing interest at 25 basis points as of December 31, 2010. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Facility at December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_467	101	The Facility and Senior Notes include certain affirmative and negative covenants, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness and maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_468	101	As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.1 million.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_469	101	Capitalized interest was $0.2 million in 2011, $0.4 million in 2010 and $0.2 million in 2009.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_470	101	(in thousands) As of December 31, 2011 2010 Liability for pension and post employment benefits $ 78,282 $ 52,583 Deferred compensation 20,698 16,193 Liability for uncertain tax positions 48,038 42,694 Other 1,411 6,238 Other liabilities (less current portion) $ 148,429 $ 117,708  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_471	101	In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, we may enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets, liabilities, and probable commitments. All of our forward contracts are designated as freestanding derivatives and are designed to minimize foreign currency exposures between the U. S. Dollar and British Pound. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_472	101	The freestanding derivative forward contracts are used to offset our exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized currently in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The gross notional amount of these contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 was $238.7 million. We held no foreign currency derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2010.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_473	101	We recognized $5.8 million of gains in 2011 from these forward contracts which are reported in the miscellaneous, net caption in the consolidated statements of operations.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_474	101	18. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest 
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_475	101	As of December 31, 2009, a noncontrolling interest held an approximate 6% residual interest in FLN. In January 2010, we reached agreement with the noncontrolling interest owner to acquire their 6% residual interest in FLN for cash consideration of $14.4 million.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_476	101	A noncontrolling interest holds a 35% residual interest in the Travel Channel. The noncontrolling interest has the right to require us to repurchase their interest and we have an option to acquire their interest. The noncontrolling interest will receive the fair value for its interest at the time their option is exercised. The put options on the noncontrolling interest in the Travel Channel become exercisable in 2014. The call options become exercisable in 2015.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_477	101	A noncontrolling interest held an 11% residual interest in our international venture with Chello Zone Media. During the second quarter 2011, the noncontrolling interest exercised their put option resulting in SNI acquiring their 11% residual interest for cash consideration of $3.4 million.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_478	101	Our consolidated balance sheets include a redeemable noncontrolling interest balance of $163 million at December 31, 2011 and $158 million at December 31, 2010.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_479	101	The Food Network is operated and organized under the terms of a general partnership (the "Partnership"). SNI and a noncontrolling owner hold interests in the Partnership.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_480	101	During 2010, we completed the rebranding of FLN to the Cooking Channel and subsequently contributed the membership interest of the Cooking Channel to the Partnership in August of 2010. The unamortized carrying value of the net assets contributed totaled $51.4 million and were primarily comprised of program assets and network distribution assets pertaining to affiliation agreements previously secured by FLN. The fair value of the net assets significantly exceeded the carrying value at the date of contribution.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_481	101	In accordance with the terms of the Partnership agreement, the noncontrolling interest owner was required to make a pro-rata capital contribution to maintain its proportionate interest in the Partnership. Based on the fair value of the assets contributed by SNI, the noncontrolling interest owner was required to make a $52.8 million contribution. At the close of our 2010 fiscal year, the noncontrolling owner had not made this contribution, and its ownership interest in the Partnership was diluted from 31% to 25%. Accordingly, following the Cooking Channel contribution, profits were allocated to the noncontrolling owner at its reduced ownership percentage, reducing net income attributable to noncontrolling interest by $8.0 million in 2010.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_482	101	On February 28, 2011, the noncontrolling owner made the $52.8 million pro-rata contribution to the Partnership and its ownership interest was returned to the pre-dilution percentage as if this pro-rata contribution had been made as of the date of the Cooking Channel contribution. The retroactive impact from restoring the noncontrolling owner’s interest in the Partnership increased net income attributable to noncontrolling interest by $8.0 million in 2011.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_483	101	The Food Network partnership agreement specifies a dissolution date of December 31, 2012. If the term of the partnership is not extended prior to that date, the agreement permits the Company, as the holder of approximately 80% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the partnership and continue its business. There are also other options for continuing the business of the partnership, including offering to purchase the noncontrolling interest, that the Company is considering. If the partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_484	101	In connection with the Separation, the following agreements between Scripps Networks Interactive and E. W. Scripps became effective on July 1, 2008:  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_485	101	The Separation and Distribution Agreement set forth the agreements between E. W. Scripps and the Company with respect to the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation and the distribution of the Company’s shares to E. W. Scripps’ shareholders and other agreements governing the relationship between E. W. Scripps and the Company. The distribution agreement provides that Scripps Networks Interactive and E. W. Scripps and its subsidiaries (other than Scripps Networks Interactive and its subsidiaries) will release and discharge each other from all liabilities, of any sort, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by the distribution agreement, except as expressly set forth in the agreement. The releases do not release any party from, among other matters, liabilities assumed or allocated to the party pursuant to the distribution agreement or the other agreements entered into in connection with the separation or from the indemnification and contribution obligations under the distribution agreement or such other agreements.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_486	101	The Transition Services Agreement provided for E. W. Scripps and Scripps Networks Interactive to provide services to each other on a compensated basis for a period of up to two years. Compensation will be on an arms-length basis. E. W. Scripps provided services or support to Scripps Networks Interactive, including information technology, human resources, accounting and finance, and facilities. The Company incurred expenses of $3.0 million in 2009, which are reported in other costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. SNI provided information technology support and services to E. W. Scripps. The Company recorded revenue of $0.6 million in 2009 related to these services, which are reported in other revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_487	101	The Employee Matters Agreement provided for the allocation of the liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans and programs, including the treatment of outstanding incentive awards, deferred compensation obligations and retirement and welfare benefit obligations between E. W. Scripps and Scripps Networks Interactive. The agreement provided that E. W. Scripps and Scripps Networks Interactive would each be responsible for all employment and benefit related obligations and liabilities for employees that work for the respective companies. The agreement also provided that Scripps Networks Interactive employees will continue to participate in certain of the E. W. Scripps benefit plans during a transition period through December 31, 2008. After the transition period, the account balances or actuarially determined values of assets and liabilities of Scripps Networks Interactive employees were transferred to the benefit plans of Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009. The agreement also governs the treatment of outstanding E. W. Scripps share-based equity awards (refer to Note 24—Capital Stock and Stock Compensation Plansfor additional discussion).  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_488	101	The Tax Allocation Agreement sets forth the allocations and responsibilities of E. W. Scripps and Scripps Networks Interactive with respect to liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for periods before and after the spin-off, tax deductions related to compensation arrangements, preparation of income tax returns, disputes with taxing authorities and indemnification of income taxes that would become due if the spin-off were taxable. Generally, E. W. Scripps and Scripps Networks Interactive will be responsible for income taxes for periods before the spin-off for their respective businesses. In 2010, we were notified that the capital loss created from our sale of uSwitch in 2009 could be utilized against capital gains generated in periods prior to our separation from E. W. Scripps which provided a benefit of $9.3 million. In connection with the 2009 year-end analysis of our tax accounts and the reconciliations of the tax provision to respective tax returns, determination was made that we owed payment to E. W. Scripps for tax related matters totaling $6.5 million as of December 31, 2009.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_489	101	We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees. Expense recognized in relation to this defined benefit retirement plan is based upon actuarial valuations and inherent in those valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, and where applicable, expected returns on assets and projected future salary rates. The discount rates used in the valuation of our defined benefit pensions are evaluated annually based on current market conditions. Benefits are generally based upon the employee’s compensation and years of service.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_490	101	We also have a nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP"). The SERP, which is unfunded, provides defined pension benefits in addition to the defined benefit from the defined benefit pension plan to eligible executives based on average earnings, years of service and age at retirement.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_491	101	In the fourth quarter of 2009, we amended the SNI Pension Plan. In accordance with the provisions of the SNI Pension Plan amendment, no additional service benefits will be earned by participants in the SNI Pension Plan after December 31, 2009. The amount of eligible compensation that is used to calculate a plan participant’s pension benefit will continue to include any compensation earned by the employee through December 31, 2019. After December 31, 2019, all plan participants will have a frozen pension benefit.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_492	101	The measurement date used for the retirement plans is December 31. The components of the expense consisted of the following:

00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_496	101	The discount rate used to determine our future pension obligations is based on a dedicated bond portfolio approach that includes securities rated Aa or better with maturities matching our expected benefit payments from the plans. The increase in compensation levels assumption is based on actual past experience and the near-term outlook.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_497	101	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the weighted-average expected rate of return and capital market forecasts for each asset class employed. Our expected rate of return on plan assets also considers our historical compounded return on plan assets for 10 and 15 year periods, which exceed our current forward-looking assumption.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_498	101	Obligations and Funded Status– Defined benefit plans pension obligations and funded status are actuarially valued as of the end of each fiscal year. The following table presents information about our employee benefit plan assets and obligations:

Plan assets are invested using a combination of active management and passive investment strategies. Risk is controlled through diversification among multiple asset classes, managers, styles, and securities. Risk is further controlled both at the manager and asset class level by assigning return targets and evaluating performance against these targets.

Plan assets are classified in one of the three levels which are described below:  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_513	101	•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_514	101	•Level 2 — Inputs, other than quoted market prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_515	101	•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions.

00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_521	101	Some of our assets, real estate and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. For assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (real estate) we use net asset values, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.

The Food Network and Cooking Channel are included in the Food Network partnership of which we own 69%. We also own 65% of Travel Channel. Each of our networks is distributed by cable and satellite distributors and telecommunication service providers. Lifestyle Media earns revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time and from affiliate fees from cable and satellite television systems.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_532	101	The accounting policies of each of our business segments are those described in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_533	101	Each of our segments may provide advertising, programming or other services to each other. In addition, certain corporate costs and expenses, including information technology, pensions and other employee benefits, and other shared services, are allocated to our business segments. The allocations are generally amounts agreed upon by management, which may differ from amounts that would be incurred if such services were purchased separately by the business segment. Corporate assets are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, investments, and deferred income taxes.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_534	101	Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating performance of our reportable segments and makes decisions about the allocation of resources to the reportable segments using a measure we call segment profit. Segment profit excludes interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, divested operating units, restructuring activities, investment results and certain other items that are included in net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_542	101	Capital Stock– SNI’s capital structure includes Common Voting Shares and Class A Common shares. The articles of incorporation provide that the holders of Class A Common shares, who are not entitled to vote on any other matters except as required by Ohio law, are entitled to elect the greater of three or one-third of the directors. The Common Voting Shares and Class A Common shares have equal dividend distribution rights.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_543	101	Incentive Plans– In connection with the Separation, we implemented a new stock based compensation plan (Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan) (the "Plan") and registered 19,000,000 common shares available for issuance under the Plan. E. W. Scripps share based awards, which included stock options and restricted stock awards, held by our employees and certain former employees of E. W. Scripps were converted to equivalent share based awards of Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. The conversions were based on the ratio of the market price of each company’s publicly traded common stock at the time of Separation. The Plan is administered by our Board of Directors.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_544	101	The Plan provides for long-term performance compensation for key employees and members of the Board of Directors. A variety of discretionary awards for employees and non-employee directors are authorized under the Plan, including incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted or nonrestricted stock awards and performance awards. The vesting of such awards may be conditioned upon either a specified period of time or the attainment of specific performance goals as determined by the administrator of the plan. The option price and term are also subject to determination by the administrator with respect to each grant. Option prices are generally expected to be set at the market price of our common stock at date of grant and option terms are not expected to exceed ten years. The Plan expires in 2018, except for options then outstanding.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_545	101	We satisfy stock option exercises and vested stock awards with newly issued shares. Shares available for future stock compensation grants totaled 6.3 million as of December 31, 2011.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_546	101	Stock Options– Stock options grant the recipient the right to purchase Class A Common shares at not less than 100% of the fair market value on the date the option is granted. Stock options granted to employees generally vest over a three year period, conditioned upon the individual’s continued employment through that period. Vesting of all share based awards are immediately accelerated upon the death or disability of the employee or upon a change in control of the Company or in the business in which the individual is employed. In addition, vesting of stock options are immediately accelerated upon the retirement of the employee. Unvested awards are forfeited if employment is terminated for other reasons. Options granted to employees prior to 2005 generally expire 10 years after grant, while options granted in 2005 and later generally have 8-year terms. Stock options granted to non-employee directors generally vest over a one-year period and have a 10-year term for options granted prior to 2010. Options granted 2010 and later have 8-year terms.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_547	101	On June 1, 2009 the Company offered eligible participants, the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding vested or unvested stock options (the "Exchange Offer") for a lesser number of restricted Class A Common Shares of equal value to the options. Each share of restricted stock granted in the option exchange vested over two years, with 50 percent vesting on each of the first and second anniversaries of the restricted shares’ issue date. Pursuant to the Exchange Offer, 834,946 shares of restricted stock were issued in exchange for 4,147,951 options surrendered.

00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_554	101	Restricted Stock Units– Awards of restricted stock units ("RSUs") are converted into equal number of Class A Common shares at the vesting date. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant. RSUs vest over a range of three to five years, conditioned upon the continued employment through that period.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_555	101	The following table presents additional information about RSUs:

00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_557	101	In addition, performance based RSUs ("PBRSUs") that have been awarded represent the right to receive a grant of RSUs if certain performance measures are met. Each award specifies a target number of shares to be issued and the specific performance criteria that must be met. The number of shares that an employee receives may be less or more than the target number of shares depending on the extent to which the specified performance measures are met or exceeded. The shares earned are issued as RSUs following the performance period and vest over a three-year service period from the date of issuance. During 2011 PBRSUs with a target of 146,381 Class A Common shares were granted with a weighted-average grant price of $52.02. The PBRSUs will have a two year performance period based on the Company’s total shareholder return.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_558	101	Restricted Stock– Awards of Class A Common shares ("restricted stock") generally require no payment by the employee. Restricted stock awards generally vest over a three year period, conditioned upon the individual’s continued employment through that period. The vesting of certain awards may also be accelerated if certain performance targets are met. Vesting of awards is immediately accelerated upon the death or disability of the employee or upon a change in control of SNI or in the business in which the individual is employed. Unvested awards are forfeited if employment is terminated for other reasons. Awards are nontransferable during the vesting period, but the shares are entitled to all the rights of an outstanding share. There are no post-vesting restrictions on shares granted to employees and non-employee directors. At the election of the employee, restricted stock awards may be converted to RSUs prior to vesting.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_559	101	Information related to restricted stock transactions is presented below:

00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_561	101	The following table presents additional information about restricted stock vesting:  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_562	101	For the years ended December 31, (in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Fair value of shares vested $ 25,777 $ 26,180 $ 3,735  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_563	101	Stock-Based Compensation– In accordance with share-based payment accounting guidance, compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of awards that grant the employee the right to the appreciation of the underlying shares, such as share options, is measured using a lattice-based binomial model. The fair value of awards that grant the employee the underlying shares is measured by the fair value of a Class A Common share.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_564	101	Compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures due to termination of employment or failure to meet performance targets, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. The requisite service period  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_565	101	is generally the vesting period stated in the award. However, because option based compensation grants vest upon the retirement of the employee, grants to retirement-eligible employees are expensed immediately and grants to employees who will become retirement eligible prior to the end of the stated vesting period are expensed over such shorter period.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_566	101	Compensation costs of stock options are estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The weighted-average assumptions SNI used in the model for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_567	101	2011 2010 2009 Weighted-average fair value of stock options granted $ 18.76 $ 13.89 $ 6.10 Assumptions used to determine fair value: Dividend yield 0.56 %  0.75 %  1.5 %  Risk-free rate of return 2.24 %  2.52 %  1.9 %  Expected life of options (years) 5 4.9 5 Expected volatility 39.0 %  38.3 %  34.0 %   
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_568	101	Dividend yield considers our historical dividend yield paid and expected dividend yield over the life of the options. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the valuation model. Expected volatility is based on a combination of historical share price volatility for a longer period and the implied volatility of exchange-traded options on our Class A Common shares.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_569	101	A summary of stock-based compensation costs is as follows:  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_570	101	For the years ended December 31, (in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Total stock-based compensation costs $ 22,444 $ 20,665 $ 17,136  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_571	101	As of December 31, 2011, $4.9 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years. In addition, $17.9 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to restricted stock awards, including RSUs and PBRSUs, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.  
00014712c1f6347af1827250b2029fa0_572	101	Share Repurchase Program– In June 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing the Company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding Class A common shares. There is no expiration date for the program and we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of Class A Common shares under the program. All shares repurchased under the program are constructively retired and returned to unissued shares. During 2011 we repurchased 11.3 million shares for approximately $500 million, including repurchasing 6.4 million shares from the Edward W. Scripps Trust at a total cost of $300 million.

0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_27	102	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_28	102	These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Prior data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the current presentation basis.  
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_29	102	The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.  
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_30	102	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is expected to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.   
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_31	102	A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, "significant" includes material matters as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.  
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_32	102	The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at June 30, 2015, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_33	102	As   of June 30, 2015 Equity Other Company Third   Party Obligations    (1)  Obligations Total (millions   of dollars) Guarantees Debt-related 86  38  124  Other 3,015  4,151  7,166  Total  3,101  4,189  7,290  (1) ExxonMobil share     
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_34	102	Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. The Corporation's outstanding unconditional purchase obligations at June 30, 2015, were similar to those at the prior year-end period. Unconditional purchase obligations as defined by accounting standards are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services.   
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_35	102	The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.    
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_36	102	In accordance with a nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007, by May 1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had been operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro Project into a "mixed enterprise" and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that if ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would "directly assume the activities" carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro Project.  
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_37	102	On September 6, 2007, affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal issued a decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9, 2014, the ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the ExxonMobil affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of expropriation, June 27, 2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded annually until the date of payment in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of the Cerro Negro Project agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double recovery between the ICSID award and all or part of an earlier award of $908 million to an ExxonMobil affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA CN, in an arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).   
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_38	102	On June 12, 2015, the Tribunal rejected in its entirety Venezuela’s October 23, 2014, application to revise the ICSID award. The Tribunal also lifted the associated stay of enforcement that had been entered upon the filing of the application to revise.   
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_39	102	Still pending is Venezuela’s February 2, 2015, application to ICSID seeking annulment of the ICSID award. That application alleges that, in issuing the ICSID award, the Tribunal exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons on which the ICSID award was based, and departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. A separate stay of the ICSID award was entered following the filing of the annulment application. On July 7, 2015, the ICSID Committee considering the annulment application heard arguments from the parties on whether to lift the stay of the award associated with that application. On July 28, 2015, the Committee issued an order that would lift the stay of enforcement unless, within 30 days, Venezuela delivers a commitment to pay the award if the application to annul is denied. In that event, the ICSID Committee would require, as a condition to the lifting of the stay, that the ExxonMobil affiliates give a commitment within 15 days that any attempt to enforce the ICSID award will take full account of the requirement in the award to avoid double recovery of amounts received under the ICC award.    
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_40	102	The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgment on the ICSID award on October 10, 2014. Motions filed by Venezuela to vacate that judgment on procedural grounds and to modify the judgment by reducing the rate of interest to be paid on the ICSID award from the entry of the court’s judgment, until the date of payment, were denied on February 13, 2015, and March 4, 2015, respectively. On March 9, 2015, Venezuela filed a notice of appeal of the court’s actions on the two motions.   
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_41	102	The District Court’s judgment on the ICSID award is currently stayed until such time as ICSID’s stay of the award entered following Venezuela’s filing of its application to annul has been lifted. The net impact of these matters on the Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.  
0014bf9d73548560cb655101db29c9d1_42	102	An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors have appealed that judgment. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or financial condition.
