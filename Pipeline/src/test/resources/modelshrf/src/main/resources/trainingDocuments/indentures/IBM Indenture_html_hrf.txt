No Bearer Debt Security delivered in exchangefor a portion of a definitive Global Debt Security will be mailed or otherwisedelivered to any location in the United States in connection with such exchange.(Section 404) Principal of, and premium and interest, if any, on, a definitiveglobal Bearer Debt Security will be payable in the manner described in theapplicable Prospectus Supplement.     U.S. Book-Entry Securities. If Debt Securities of a series are to berepresented by a definitive global Registered Debt Security to be deposited withor on behalf of a U.S. Depositary, such Debt Securities ("U.S. Book-Entry DebtSecurities") will be represented by a definitive Global Debt Security registeredin the name of the U.S. Depositary or its nominee. Upon the issuance of adefinitive Global Debt Security registered in the name of the U.S. Depositary,the U.S. Depositary will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfersystem, the respective principal amounts of the U.S. Book-Entry Debt Securitiesrepresented by such Global Debt Security to the accounts of institutions thathave accounts with such depositary or its nominee ("participants"). The accountsto be credited shall be designated by the underwriters or agents for the sale ofsuch U.S. Book-Entry Debt Securities or by the Company, if such Debt Securitiesare offered and sold directly by the Company. Ownership of U.S.                                        8<PAGE>Book-Entry Debt Securities will be limited to participants or persons that mayhold interests through participants. Ownership of U.S. Book-Entry DebtSecurities will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effectedonly through, records maintained by the U.S. Depositary or its nominee for theapplicable definitive Global Security or by participants or persons that holdthrough participants. So long as the U.S. Depositary, or its nominee, is theregistered owner of such Global Debt Security, such depositary or such nominee,as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the U.S.Book-Entry Debt Securities represented by such Global Debt Security for allpurposes under the Indenture. Payment of principal of, and premium and interest,if any, on, U.S. Book-Entry Debt Securities will be made to the U.S. Depositaryor its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner or the holder of theGlobal Debt Security representing such U.S. Book-Entry Debt Securities. Ownersof U.S. Book-Entry Debt Securities will not be entitled to have such DebtSecurities registered in their names in the Security Register, will not receiveor be entitled to receive physical delivery of such Debt Securities indefinitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders thereof underthe Indenture. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers ofsecurities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Suchlimits and such laws impair the ability to purchase or transfer U.S. Book-EntryDebt Securities.     The Company expects that the U.S. Depositary for U.S. Book-Entry DebtSecurities of a series, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, or premiumor interest, if any, on, the related definitive Global Debt Security, willimmediately credit participants' accounts with payments in amounts proportionateto their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such GlobalDebt Security as shown on the records of such Depositary. The Company alsoexpects that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in suchGlobal Debt Security held through such participants will be governed by standinginstructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities heldfor the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in "street name", andwill be the responsibility of such participants. CERTAIN COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY     Limitation on Merger, Consolidation and Certain Sales of Assets.

No Event of Default withrespect to a single series of indebtedness issued under an Indenture (and anysupplemental indentures) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default withrespect to any other series of indebtedness issued thereunder. (Section 601)     Each Indenture provides that the applicable Trustee will, within 90 daysafter the occurrence of a default with respect to the Debt Securities of anyseries, give to the holders of the Debt Securities of such series notice of alluncured and unwaived defaults known to it; provided that, except in the case ofdefault in the payment of principal of, or premiums or interest, if any, on, ora sinking fund installment, if any, with respect to any of the Debt Securitiesof such series, such Trustee will be protected in withholding such notice if itin good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interestof the holders of the Debt Securities of such series.

(Section 613) The holders ofa majority in principal amount of a series of outstanding Debt Securities alsohave certain rights to rescind any declaration of acceleration with respect tosuch series after all Events of Default with respect to such series not arisingfrom such declaration shall have been cured.

(Section 101 of Senior Indenture)                                        14<PAGE>    The Senior Indenture provides that the Company may omit to comply with therestrictive covenants described above under "Limitation on Secured Indebtedness"and "Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions" if the holders of not lessthan a majority in principal amount of all series of outstanding Debt Securitiesaffected thereby (acting as one class) waive compliance with such restrictivecovenants. (Section 1107 of Senior Indenture)SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES    The Subordinated Debt Securities will be unsecured and will be subject tothe subordination provisions described below.     The payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on theSubordinated Debt Securities is subordinated in right of payment, as set forthin the Subordinated Indenture, to the payment when due of all SeniorIndebtedness. (Section 1501 of Subordinated Indenture) However, payment from themoney or the proceeds of U.S. government obligations held in any defeasancetrust is not subordinate to any Senior Indebtedness or subject to therestrictions described herein. (Section 1512 of Subordinated Indenture). Claimsof creditors of the Company's subsidiaries, including trade creditors, securedcreditors and creditors holding guarantees issued by such subsidiaries, andclaims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such subsidiaries generally willhave priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries overthe claims of creditors of the Company, including holders of the SubordinatedDebt Securities, even though such obligations may not constitute SeniorIndebtedness. The Subordinated Debt Securities therefore will be effectivelysubordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders(if any) of subsidiaries of the Company.     Senior Indebtedness is defined in the Subordinated Indenture as theprincipal of, premium, if any, and interest on, (i) all the Company'sindebtedness for money borrowed, other than the subordinated securities issuedunder the Subordinated Indenture, whether outstanding on the date of executionof the Subordinated Indenture or thereafter created, assumed or incurred, exceptsuch indebtedness as is by its terms expressly stated to be not superior inright of payment to the subordinated securities issued under the SubordinatedIndenture or to rank pari passu with the subordinated securities issued underthe Subordinated Indenture and (ii) any deferrals, renewals or extensions of anysuch Senior Indebtedness, except that Senior Indebtedness will not include (1)any obligation of the Company to any subsidiary, (2) any liability for Federal,state, local or other taxes owed or owing by the Company, (3) any accountspayable or other liability to trade creditors arising in the ordinary course ofbusiness (including guarantees thereof or instruments evidencing suchliabilities), (4) any indebtedness, guarantee or obligation of the Company whichis expressly subordinate or junior in right of payment in any respect to anyother indebtedness, guarantee or obligation of the Company, including any seniorsubordinated indebtedness and any subordinated obligations, (5) any obligationswith respect to any capital stock, or (6) any indebtedness incurred in violationof the Subordinated Indenture. The term "indebtedness for money borrowed" asused in the foregoing sentence includes, without limitation, any obligation of,or any obligation guaranteed by, the Company for the repayment of borrowedmoney, whether or not evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or other writteninstruments, and any deferred obligation for the payment of the purchase priceof property or assets. (Section 101 of Subordinated Indenture) There is nolimitation on the issuance of additional Senior Indebtedness of the Company. TheSenior Debt Securities constitute Senior Indebtedness under the SubordinatedIndenture. The Subordinated Debt Securities will rank pari passu with othersubordinated indebtedness of the Company.     The Company may not pay principal of, premium (if any) or interest on theSubordinated Debt Securities, make any deposits pursuant to the defeasanceprovisions in the Subordinated Indenture or otherwise purchase, redeem or retireany Subordinated Debt Securities (collectively, "pay the Subordinated DebtSecurities") if (i) any Senior Indebtedness is not paid when due or (ii) anyother default on Senior Indebtedness occurs and the maturity of such SeniorIndebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms unless the default hasbeen cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded                                        15<PAGE>or such Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full. However, the Company may paythe Subordinated Securities without regard to the foregoing if the Company andthe Subordinated Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from theRepresentatives of the holders of Senior Indebtedness with respect to whicheither of the events set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediatelypreceding sentence has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of anydefault (other than a default described in clause (i) or (ii) of the secondpreceding sentence) with respect to any Senior Indebtedness pursuant to whichthe maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice(except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or theexpiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company may not pay theSubordinated Securities for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencingupon the receipt by the Subordinated Trustee (with a copy to the Company) ofwritten notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representatives ofthe holders of Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a PaymentBlockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter (or earlier if such PaymentBlockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Subordinated Trusteeand the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice, (2)because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is no longer continuingor (3) because such Senior Indebtedness has been repaid in full).Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding sentence,unless the holders of Senior Indebtedness or the Representatives of such holdershave accelerated the maturity of such Senior Indebtedness, the Company mayresume payments on the Subordinated Debt Securities after the end of suchPayment Blockage Period. Not more than one Blockage Notice may be given in anyconsecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respectto Senior Indebtedness during such period. (Section 1503 of SubordinatedIndenture)     Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company to creditorsupon a total or partial liquidation or dissolution or reorganization of orsimilar proceeding relating to the Company or their property, the holders ofSenior Indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full of the SeniorIndebtedness before the holders of Subordinated Debt Securities are entitled toreceive any payment, and until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, anypayment or distribution to which holders of Subordinated Debt Securities wouldbe entitled but for the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Indenture(other than distributions of stock and certain debt securities subordinated tothe Senior Indebtedness) will be made to holders of the Senior Indebtedness astheir interests may appear. (Section 1502 of Subordinated Indenture) If adistribution is made to holders of Subordinated Debt Securities that, due to thesubordination provisions, should not have been made to them, such holders ofSubordinated Debt Securities are required to hold it in trust for the holders ofSenior Indebtedness, and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.(Section 1505 of Subordinated Indenture)     If payment of the Subordinated Debt Securities is accelerated because of anEvent of Default, the Company or the Subordinated Trustee will promptly notifythe holders of Senior Indebtedness or the Representatives of such holders of theacceleration. The Company may not pay the Subordinated Securities until fiveBusiness Days after such holders or the Representatives of the SeniorIndebtedness receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay theSubordinated Securities only if the subordination provisions of the SubordinatedIndenture otherwise permit payment at that time. (Section 1505 of SubordinatedIndenture)     By reason of such subordination provisions contained in the SubordinatedIndenture, in the event of insolvency, creditors of the Company who are holdersof Senior Indebtedness may recover more, ratably, than the holders ofSubordinated Debt Securities, and creditors of the Company who are not holdersof Senior Indebtedness may recover less, ratably, than holders of SeniorIndebtedness and may recover more, ratably, than the holders of SubordinatedIndebtedness.                                        16<PAGE>                       DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED STOCK     The following is a description of certain general terms and provisions ofthe Preferred Stock.

         carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination          in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which          would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect          to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the          minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and          executive committees of the Company and the Subsidiaries since          the date of the latest audited balance sheet, through a specified          date not more than five business days prior to the date of the          letter; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who          have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the          Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events          subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements          incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final          Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to          believe that:                    (1) any unaudited financial statements included or               incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final               Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects               with applicable accounting requirements and with the               published rules and regulations of the Commission with               respect to financial statements included or incorporated in               quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; or               that said unaudited financial statements are not stated on a               basis substantially consistent with that of the audited               financial statements included or incorporated in the               Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; or<PAGE>                                                                         20                    (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date               of the most recent financial statements incorporated in the               Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were,               at a specified date not more than five business days prior               to the date of the letter, any increases in long-term debt               of the Company and its subsidiaries or decreases in the               capital stock of the Company or decreases in the               stockholders' equity of the Company and its subsidiaries as               compared with the amounts shown on the most recent               consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the               Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the               period from the date of the most recent financial statements               included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and               the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any               deceases, as compared with the corresponding period in the               preceding year, or the preceding quarter, in total revenue,               gross profit, earnings before income taxes, net earnings or               in total or per share amounts of net earnings applicable to               common stockholders of the Company and its subsidiaries,               except in all instances for increases or decreases set forth               in such letter, in which case the letter shall be               accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the               significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed               necessary by the Representatives;                            (iii) they have performed certain other procedures as a result          of which they determined that the information described in a          schedule to be delivered on behalf of the Underwriters of an          accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to          accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the          general ledger of the Company) set forth in the Registration          Statement, as amended, the Final Prospectus, as amended or          supplemented, and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement          (including selected accounting, financial or statistical          information included or incorporated in the Company's Annual          Report on Form 10-K incorporated in the Final Prospectus or any          of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated          therein), agrees with the general ledger of the Company and its          subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation;          and                             (iv) if unaudited pro forma financial statements are included          or incorporated in the Registration Statement or the Final          Prospectus, on the basis of a reading of the unaudited pro forma          financial statements, carrying out certain specified procedures,          inquiries of certain officials of <PAGE>                                                                         21          the Company and the acquired company who have responsibility for          financial and accounting matters, and proving the arithmetic          accuracy of the application of the pro forma adjustments to the          historical amounts in the pro forma financial statements, nothing          came to their attention which caused them to believe that the          pro forma financial statements do not comply in form in all          material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of          Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X or that the pro forma adjustments          have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the          compilation of such statements.          References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) includeany supplements thereto at the date of the letter.          (f)  Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates     as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the     Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease     specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of     this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a     prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the     Company and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred     to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the reasonable judgment of the     Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or     inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities     as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final     Prospectus.          (g)  On or after the Execution Time (i) no downgrading shall have     occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or     preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating     organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes     of Rule 438(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall     have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with     possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's     debt securities or preferred stock.          (h)  Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished     to the Representatives such further legal opinions, information,     certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably     request.          (i)  The Company shall have accepted Delayed Delivery Contracts     in any case where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the     Underwriters have been approved by the Company.<PAGE>                                                                         22          (j)  The Company also agrees to comply with such other conditions     as may be set forth on Schedule I hereto.          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall nothave been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in thisAgreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above orelsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respectsreasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives andcounsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of theUnderwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, theClosing Date by the Representatives.  Notice of such cancellation shall begiven to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed inwriting.          6.  Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.  If the sale of the              ----------------------------------------Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition tothe obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is notsatisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part ofthe Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provisionhereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, theCompany will reimburse the Underwriters severally through theRepresentatives upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (includingreasonable fees and disbursements of one Underwriter's counsel) approved bythe Representatives that shall have been incurred by them in connectionwith the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.          7.

Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Issuer and the     Agent soliciting such offer, the Agents are authorized to solicit     offers to purchase Securities <PAGE>                                                                          4     only in fully registered form in denominations of $1,000 or any     multiple thereof.  The authorized denominations of Securities not     denominated in U.S. dollars will be determined by the Issuer at the     time of sale.  Each Agent shall communicate to the Issuer, orally or     in writing, each reasonable offer to purchase the Securities received     by it as Agent.  The Issuer shall have the sole right to accept offers     to purchase the Securities and may reject any such offer, in whole or     in part.  Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion     reasonably exercised, without notice to the Issuer, to reject any     offer to purchase the Securities received by it, in whole or in part,     and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement     contained herein.          No Security which the Issuer has agreed to sell pursuant to this     Agreement shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for, or     sold, by the Issuer until such Security shall have been delivered to     the purchaser thereof against payment by such purchaser.          (c)  At the time of delivery of, and payment for, any Securities     sold by the Issuer as a result of a solicitation made by, or offer to     purchase received by, an Agent, the Issuer agrees to pay such Agent a     commission in accordance with the schedule set forth in Exhibit A     hereto, unless otherwise agreed.          (d)  Administrative procedures respecting the sale of Securities     (the "Procedures") shall be agreed upon from time to time by the     Agents and the Issuer.

Certain Agreements of the Issuer.  The Issuer agrees with the              ---------------------------------Agents that, in connection with each offering of Securities,          (a)  The Issuer will advise each Agent promptly of any proposal     to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus     (other than an amendment or supplement (i) providing solely for a     change in the terms of the Securities, (ii) by means of the filing of     materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, (iii) relating     to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the     Securities or (iv) that is a pricing amendment or supplement relating     to Securities the purchase of which was not solicited by any Agent)     and will afford the Agents a reasonable opportunity to comment on any     such proposed amendment or supplement; and the Issuer will also advise     each Agent of the filing of any such amendment or supplement and of     the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings in     respect of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof and will     use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order     and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.          (b)  If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities     is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a     result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would     include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any     material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light     of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus     is delivered, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to     amend the Registration Statement or the Prospectus to comply with the     Act, the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations (other than as     contemplated in the parenthetical clause of Section 4(a) hereof), the     Issuer will promptly notify each Agent to suspend solicitation of     offers to purchase the Securities; and if the Issuer shall decide so     to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus,     it will promptly advise each Agent by telephone (with confirmation in     writing) and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission an     amendment or supplement which will correct such <PAGE>                                                                          6     statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such     compliance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at the time of any     notification to suspend solicitations, any Agent shall own any of the     Securities with the intention of reselling them as contemplated by     Section 11 hereof, or the Issuer has accepted an offer to purchase     Securities but the related settlement has not occurred, the Issuer,     subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section, will     promptly prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or     supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an     amendment which will effect such compliance.          (c)  The Issuer, during the period when a prospectus relating to     the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, will file     promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission     pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.  In     addition, the Issuer will promptly furnish each Agent with copies of     all press releases or announcements to the general public.  The Issuer     will also immediately notify each Agent of any downgrading in the     rating of the Securities or any other debt securities of the Issuer,     or any proposal to downgrade the rating of the Securities or any other     debt securities of the Issuer, by any "nationally recognized statis-     tical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)     under the Act), as soon as the Issuer learns of such downgrading or     proposal to downgrade.          (d)  The Issuer will furnish to each Agent copies of the     Prospectus and all amendments and supplements thereto, and all     amendments to the Registration Statement after the date hereof (other     than an amendment or supplement (i) relating to an offering by the     Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Securities or (ii) that     solely specifies the terms of the Securities the purchase of which was     not solicited by any Agent), in each case as soon as available and in     such quantities as are reasonably requested.          (e)  The Issuer will arrange for the qualification of the     Securities for sale and the determination of their eligibility for     investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Agents     designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as     required for the distribution of the Securities.<PAGE>                                                                          7          (f)  So long as any Securities are outstanding, the Issuer will     furnish to the Agents, (i) as soon as practicable after the end of     each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to stockholders for such     year, (ii) as soon as available, a copy of each report or definitive     proxy statement of the Issuer, if any, filed with the Commission under     the Exchange Act or mailed to stockholders, and (iii) from time to     time, such other information concerning the Issuer as the Agents may     reasonably request.          (g)  The Issuer will pay all expenses incident to the performance     of its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse each Agent     for any expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel)     incurred by it in connection with qualification of the Securities for     sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the     laws of such jurisdictions as such Agent may designate and the     printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by     investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, for     expenses incurred in distributing the Prospectus and all supplements     thereto, any preliminary prospectuses and any preliminary prospectus     supplements to each Agent and for the reasonable fees and     disbursements of counsel to the Agents.          (h)  The Issuer confirms as of the date hereof, and each     acceptance by the Issuer of an offer to purchase Securities will be     deemed an affirmation, that the Issuer is in compliance with all     provisions of Section 1 of the Laws of Florida, Chapter 92-198, An Act                                                                     ------     Relating to Disclosure of Doing Business with Cuba, and the Issuer     --------------------------------------------------     further agrees that if it commences engaging in business with the     government of Cuba or with any person or affiliate located in Cuba     after the date the Registration Statement becomes effective with the     Commission or with the Florida Department of Banking and Finance (the     "Department"), whichever date is later, or if the information reported     in the Prospectus, if any, concerning the Issuer's business with Cuba     or with any person or affiliate located in Cuba changes in any     material way, the Issuer will provide the Department notice of such     business or change, as appropriate, in a form acceptable to the     Department.<PAGE>                                                                          8          5.

(e) If a Foreign Currency in which any Security is denominated or   payable ceases to be recognized both by the government of the country   which issued such currency and for the settlement of transactions by   public institutions of or within the international banking community, or   if ECU ceases to be used within the European Monetary System, or if any   other currency unit in which a Security is denominated or payable ceases   to be used for the purposes for which it was established, in each case   as determined in good faith by the Company, then with respect to each   date for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if   any, on the applicable Security denominated or payable in such Foreign   Currency, ECU or such other currency unit occurring after the last date   on which such Foreign Currency, ECU or such other currency unit was so   used (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall become the currency of   payment for use on each such payment date (but ECU or the Foreign   Currency or the currency unit previously the currency of payment shall,   at the Company's election, resume being the currency of payment on the   first such payment date preceded by 15 Business Days during which the   circumstances which gave rise to the Dollar becoming such currency no   longer prevail, in each case as determined in good faith by the   Company). The Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the Trustee and   by the Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holder of such Security with   respect to such payment date shall be the Dollar Equivalent of the   Foreign Currency or, in the case of a currency unit, the Dollar   Equivalent of the currency unit, as determined by the Exchange Rate   Agent (which shall be delivered in writing to the Trustee not later than   the fifth Business Day prior to the applicable payment date) as of the   Conversion Date or, if later, the date most recently preceding the   payment date in question on which such determination is possible of   performance, but not more than 15 days before such payment date (such   Conversion Date or date preceding a <PAGE>                                     36   payment date as aforesaid being called the "Valuation Date") in the   manner provided in paragraph (g) or (h) below.     (f) If the Holder of a Registered Security denominated in a currency   unit elects payment in a specified Foreign Currency or currency unit as   provided for by paragraph (b) and such Foreign Currency ceases to be   used both by the government of the country which issued such currency   and for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or   within the international banking community, or if ECU ceases to be used   within the European Monetary System, or if another currency unit ceases   to be used for the purposes for which it is established, in each case as   determined in good faith by the Company, such Holder shall (subject to   paragraph (e) above) receivable payment in the currency unit in which   the Security is denominated. Each payment covered by an election   pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be governed by the provisions of   this paragraph (f) (but, subject to any contravening valid election   pursuant to paragraph (b) above, the specified Foreign Currency or ECU   or other currency unit shall, at the Company's election, resume being   the currency or currency unit, as applicable, of payment with respect to   Holders who have so elected, but only with respect to payments on   payment dates preceded by 15 Business Days during which the   circumstances which gave rise to such currency unit becoming the   currency unit of payment, no longer prevail, in each case as determined   in good faith by the Company).     (g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be   determined by the Exchange Rate Agent as of each Valuation Date and   shall be obtained by converting the specified Foreign Currency into   Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Valuation Date.     (h) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined   by the Exchange Rate Agent as of each Valuation Date and shall be the   sum obtained by adding together the results obtained by converting the   Specified Amount of each Component Currency into Dollars at the Market   Exchange Rate on the Valuation Date for such Component Currency.     (i) For purposes of this Section 410 the following terms shall have   the following meanings:        A "Component Currency" shall mean any currency which, on the     Conversion Date, was a component currency of the relevant currency     unit, including without limitation ECU.        A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number     of units (including decimals) which such Component Currency     represented in the relevant currency unit, on the Conversion Date or,     if ECU and such currency unit is being used for settlement of     transactions by public institutions of or within the European     Communities or was so used after the Conversion Date, the Valuation     Date or the last date the currency unit was so used, whichever is     later. If after such date the official unit of any Component Currency     is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount     of such Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same     proportion. If after such date two or more Component Currencies are     consolidated into a single currency, the respective Specified Amounts     of such Component Currencies shall be replaced by an <PAGE>                                     37     amount in such single currency equal to the sum of the respective     Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component Currencies expressed     in such single currency, and such amount shall thereafter be a     Specified Amount and such single currency shall thereafter be a     Component Currency. If after such date any Component Currency shall be     divided into two or more currencies, the Specified Amount of such     Component Currency shall be replaced by specified amounts of such two     or more currencies, the sum of which, at the Market Exchange Rate of     such two or more currencies on the date of such replacement, shall be     equal to the Specified Amount of such former Component Currency and     such amounts shall thereafter be Specified Amounts and such currencies     shall thereafter be Component Currencies.        "Market Exchange Rate" shall mean, as of any date, for any currency     or currency unit the noon Dollar buying rate for that currency or     currency unit, as the case may be, for cable transfers quoted in New     York City on such date as certified for customs purposes by the     Federal Reserve Bank of New York or such other rate as may be     established pursuant to Section 202 or Section 301, as the case may     be. If such rates are not available for any reason with respect to one     or more currencies or currency units for which an Exchange Rate is     required, the Exchange Rate Agent shall use, in its sole discretion     and without liability on its part, such quotation of the Federal     Reserve Bank of New York as of the most recent available date, or     quotations from one or more major banks in New York City or in the     country of issue of the currency or currency unit in question, or such     other quotations as the Exchange Rate Agent shall deem appropriate.     Unless otherwise specified by the Exchange Rate Agent, if there is     more than one market for dealing in any currency or currency unit by     reason of foreign exchange regulations or otherwise, the market to be     used in respect of such currency or currency unit shall be that upon     which a nonresident issuer of securities designated in such currency     or currency unit would, as determined in its sole discretion and     without liability on the part of the Exchange Rate Agent, purchase     such currency or currency unit in order to make payments in respect of     such securities.        All decisions and determinations of the Exchange Rate Agent     regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar     Equivalent of the Currency Unit and the Market Exchange Rate shall be     in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be      conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company     and all Holders of the Securities and Coupons denominated or payable     in the relevant currency or currency units. In the event that a     Foreign Currency ceases to be used both by the government of the     country which issued such currency and for the settlement of     transactions by public institutions of or within the international     banking community, the Company, after learning thereof, will     immediately give notice thereof to the Trustee (and the Trustee will     promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section 106     to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. In the event the ECU     ceases to be used within the European Monetary System, or any other     currency unit in which Securities or Coupons are denominated or     payable, ceases to be used for the purposes for which it was     established, the Company, after learning thereof, will immediately     give notice thereof to the Trustee (and the Trustee will promptly     thereafter give notice in the manner provided <PAGE>                                     38     in Section 106 to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. Any     actions taken pursuant to the parentheticals at the end of the first     sentence of Section 410(e) and at the end of Section 410(f) shall be     promptly set forth in like notices from the Company to the Trustee and     then from the Trustee to the Holders (which notice may be mailed with     payment to the Holders).        Subject to the provisions of Sections 701 and 703, the Trustee     shall be fully justified and protected in relying and acting upon     information received by it from the Company and the Exchange Rate     Agent, and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to     determine such information independently.

(2) Restated for AICPA Statement of Position, "Software Revenue Recognition." (3) The company reported on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30,    1995 preferred stock dividends and transaction costs totaling $57 million.    Excluded from the ratio computation are transaction costs of $42 million    relating to the repurchase of Series A 7 1/2 percent preferred stock    depositary shares. Included are preferred stock dividends of $15 million, or    $32 million representing the pre-tax earnings which would be required to    cover such dividend requirements based on IBM's effective income tax rate.    For the periods ending September 30 and December 31, 1994, preferred stock    dividends are also on a pre-tax earnings basis.
