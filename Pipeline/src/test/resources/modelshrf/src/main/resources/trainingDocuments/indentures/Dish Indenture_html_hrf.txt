Any weekly average yields as calculated by interpolation shall be rounded to the nearest 0.01%, with any figure of 0.005% or more being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield shall be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the independent investment banking institution.
