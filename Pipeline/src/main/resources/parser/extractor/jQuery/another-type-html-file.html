date of such Borrowing)&nbsp;that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#x2019;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with and at the time required by Section&nbsp;2.02(b)&nbsp;and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if any Lender does not in fact make its share of the applicable
Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand an amount equal to such applicable share in immediately available funds with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (<u>A</u>)&nbsp;in the case of a payment to be made by such

interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the
applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#x2019;s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender

Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or, to fund its participation or to make its payment under Section&nbsp;9.07. </p>

such Lender shall immediately (<u>a</u>)&nbsp;notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (<u>b</u>)&nbsp;purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to
share the excess payment in respect of such Loans pro rata with each of them; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances
described in Section&nbsp;10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase
price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender&#x2019;s ratable share (according to the proportion of (<u>i</u>)&nbsp;the amount of such paying Lender&#x2019;s required repayment to (<u>ii</u>)&nbsp;the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Lender)&nbsp;of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section&nbsp;10.09)&nbsp;with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error)&nbsp;of participations purchased under this
Section&nbsp;2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all
notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

the provision of any Incremental Revolving Commitment, Supplemental Term Loan Commitments or Supplemental Revolving Commitments), and notice of or proof of reliance by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party upon this Guaranty or
acceptance of this Guaranty, the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended, waived or accrued, in reliance upon this Guaranty; and all dealings

failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations by the Guarantors or (<u>d</u>)&nbsp;any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrower or such Guarantor) that

Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties against such Guarantor. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even
though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement, subrogation, exoneration, contribution or indemnification or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other

shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Guaranty. The Collateral Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission be confirmed by a

of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days&#x2019; notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent shall not
be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may,
without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. To the extent permitted by law, each Grantor hereby waives any claim against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any
Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree.

payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations made by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party may be rescinded by such party and any of the Guaranteed Obligations continued, (<u>b</u>)&nbsp;the Guaranteed Obligations, or the

any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for this Agreement or any property subject thereto. When making any demand hereunder against any Grantor, the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party may,
but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any other Grantor, and any failure by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any
other Grantor or any release of the Borrower or any other Grantor shall not relieve any Grantor in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or any Grantor not so released of its several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not
impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party against any Grantor. For the purpose hereof &#x201C;demand&#x201D; shall include the commencement and continuance of

to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further
notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. To the extent permitted by law, each Pledgor hereby waives any claim against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been
