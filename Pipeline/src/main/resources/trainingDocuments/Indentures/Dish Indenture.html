The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. The Notes will be payable both as to principal and interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders of Notes. Unless otherwise designated by the Company, the Company&#x2019;s office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. </DIV>
<DIV style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt" align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) <U>Paying Agent and Registrar</U>.
