including payment of any breakage costs for reallocated LIBOR Loans) in accordance with the readjusted Pro Rata shares. Unless expressly agreed by Borrowers, Agent and Issuing Bank, no reinstatement of a Defaulting Lender shall constitute a waiver

defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor other than Full Payment of Obligations and waives, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to revoke any guaranty of Obligations as long as it is a Borrower. It is

Lender shall forfeit any other rights or remedies, including the right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or other Person, whether because of any Applicable Laws pertaining to &#147;election of remedies&#148; or otherwise, each
Borrower consents to such action and waives any claim based upon it, even if the action may result in loss of any rights of subrogation that any Borrower might otherwise have had. Any election of remedies that results in denial or impairment of the
right of Agent or any Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower&#146;s obligation to pay the full amount of the Obligations. Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election
of remedies, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to any security for Obligations, even though that election of remedies destroys such Borrower&#146;s rights of subrogation against any other Person. Agent may bid Obligations, in whole or
