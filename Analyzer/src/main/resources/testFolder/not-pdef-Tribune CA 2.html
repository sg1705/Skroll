Section1.09. Limited Condition Acquisitions.  
In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires that no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Borrower, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Borrower has exercised its option under the first sentence of this Section1.09, and any Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default occurs following the date the definitive agreements for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition were entered into and prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, any such Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing solely for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder.  
79  
Section1.10. Pro Forma Calculations.  
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any test or covenant contained in this Agreement, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio and the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio shall be calculated (including for purposes of Sections 2.14 and 2.17) on a Pro Forma Basis with respect to each Specified Transaction occurring during the applicable four quarter period to which such calculation relates, and/or subsequent to the end of such four quarter period but not later than the date of such calculation; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, when calculating the Consolidated Total Secured Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio and the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio, as applicable, for purposes of determining the applicable percentage of Excess Cash Flow for purposes of Section2.05(b), any Specified Transaction and any related adjustment contemplated in the definition of Pro Forma Basis (and corresponding provisions of the definition of Consolidated EBITDA) that occurred subsequent to the end of the applicable four quarter period shall not be given Pro Forma Effect.  
(b) For purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated Total Secured Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio, if no Section6.01 Financials have been delivered to the Administrative Agent at such time, such ratio shall be calculated based on Consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Borrower ended March30, 2014.  
(c) [Reserved].  
(d) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, for purposes of:  
(i) 
determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires the calculation of the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio or the Consolidated Total Secured Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio; or  
(ii) 
testing baskets set forth in this Agreement (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated Total Assets);  
in each case, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Acquisition, an “LCA Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into (the “LCA Test Date”), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if  
80  
 they had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period, the Borrower could have taken such action on the relevant LCA Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Borrower has made an LCA Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCA Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets of the Borrower or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations. If the Borrower has made an LCA Election for any Limited Condition Acquisition, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or basket availability with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, or the making of Investments, Restricted Payments, prepayments of Junior Financing, Dispositions, fundamental changes under Section7.04 or the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary on or following the relevant LCA Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Acquisition is consummated or the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated, except to the extent that such calculation would result (x)in a lower Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio or Consolidated Total Secured Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio, as applicable, or (y)a larger basket than would apply if such calculation was made without giving Pro Forma Effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition or other actions to be taken in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof).  
(e) For purposes of calculating the principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to (w)either Section2.14(a) or Section2.17(a), in each case, in reliance on clause (y)of the definition “Incremental Amount,” (x)Section7.03(f), (y)Section7.03(o) or (z)Section7.03(v) in reliance of the ratio test in clause (B)of the proviso of the definition of Permitted Additional Debt (collectively, the “Ratio-Based Debt Baskets”), any pro forma calculation of the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio or the Consolidated Total Secured Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio, as applicable, shall be determined (1)without netting the proceeds thereof and (2)without giving effect to any other incurrence of Indebtedness on the date of determination pursuant to any clause or sub-clause of Section7.03 other than a Ratio-Based Debt Basket.  
(f) For purposes of calculating the amount of Liens permitted to be incurred pursuant to (x)(solely with respect to Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section2.14(a) in reliance of clause (y)of the definition of “Incremental Amount”) Section7.01(a), (y) 
81  
 (solely with respect to Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section2.17(a) in reliance of clause (y)of the definition of “Incremental Amount”) Section7.01(gg)(ii) or (z)Section7.01(gg)(v) (collectively, the “Ratio-Based Lien Baskets”), any pro forma calculation of the Consolidated Total Secured Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio shall be determined without giving effect to any other incurrence of Liens on the date of determination pursuant to any clause or sub-clause of Section7.01 other than a Ratio-Based Lien Basket.  
Section1.11. Calculation of Baskets.  
(a) Unless otherwise specified herein, the baskets and other exceptions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement (or in any defined term used in Article VII) shall be tested solely at the time of consummation of the relevant transaction or action utilizing any of such baskets or other exceptions and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any of such baskets (including ratio based baskets) are exceeded as a result of fluctuations to Consolidated Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed Test Period after the last time such baskets (including ratio based baskets) were calculated for any purpose under ArticleVII, such baskets (including ratio based baskets) will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations. If any Indebtedness or Liens securing Indebtedness are incurred to Refinance Indebtedness or Liens securing Indebtedness, in each case, initially incurred in reliance on a basket measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of incurrence, and such Refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated Total Assets restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the Consolidated Total Assets on the date of such Refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated Total Assets restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Indebtedness or Indebtedness secured by such Liens, as applicable, does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness or Indebtedness secured by such Liens, as applicable, being Refinanced, plus an amount equal to premiums, defeasance costs and fees and expenses in connection therewith.  
(b) For purposes of determining whether the incurrence of any Indebtedness or Lien or the making of any Investment, Disposition, Restricted Payment, Sale Leaseback or prepayment, redemption, purchase, defeasance or other satisfaction of Junior Financing complies with any basket that is based upon the greater of a specified Dollar amount and a percentage of Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Total Assets shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis.  
Section1.12. Time Periods.  
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any and all time periods for the submission by the Borrower of any notice hereunder (including, without limitation, a notice in respect of a conversion of a Loan, a continuation of a Loan, a mandatory prepayment or any optional prepayment of any Loan, but excluding notices in respect of new Borrowings) may be adjusted by the Administrative Agent in in its sole discretion.  
82  
Section1.13. Loan Amounts.  
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any minimum amounts or multiples of any amount specified in this Agreement (including, without limitation, any minimum amounts or multiples of any amount in respect of any Borrowings, mandatory prepayments, optional prepayments, Incremental Commitments or New Incremental Indebtedness) may be in such lower minimum amounts or multiples as agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion.  
ARTICLE II  
THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS  
Section2.01. The Loans.  
(a) The Term Borrowing. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term Lender severally agrees to make a single loan to the Borrower on the Closing Date in an amount not to exceed such Term Lender’s Initial Term Commitment (the “Initial Term Loans”). The Term Borrowing shall consist of Initial Term Loans made simultaneously by the Term Lenders in accordance with their respective Initial Term Commitments. Amounts borrowed under this Section2.01(a)and subsequently repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Initial Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans as further provided herein. In the event that the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or prior to the Termination Date, each Term Lender’s Initial Term Commitment shall automatically expire, and each Term Lender shall have no further obligation to make Initial Term Loans.  
(b) [Reserved].  
Section2.02. Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.  
(a) Each Term Borrowing, each conversion of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i)2:00p.m. (New York City time) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion of Base Rate Loans to, or continuation of, Eurodollar Rate Loans, or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans (provided that with respect to the Term Borrowing consisting of Initial Term Loans on the Closing Date, such notice may be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the requested date of such Borrowing) and (ii)12:00p.m. (New York  
83  
 City time) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that (other than in case of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans on the Closing Date) if the Borrower wishes to request Eurodollar Rate Loans having an Interest Period other than one, two, three or six months in duration as provided in the definition of Interest Period, the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00p.m. (New York City time) five Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Appropriate Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later than 10:00a.m. (New York City time) three Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the Appropriate Lenders. Each written notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section2.02(a)shall be delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent in the form of a Committed Loan Notice, and each telephone notice shall be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, in each case, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of, or conversion to, Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice shall specify (i)whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii)the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii)the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv)the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Tranche is to be converted and (v)if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  
(b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender of the amount of its ratable share of the Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in Section2.02(a). In the case of a Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent’s  
84  
 Office not later than 11:00a.m. (New York City time)(or 2:00 p.m. (New York City time)in the case of Base Rate Loans)on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i)crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii)wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to)the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.  
(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due under Section3.05 in connection therewith. During the existence of an Event of Default, at the election of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans.  
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Administrative Agent’s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.  
(e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than 15 Interest Periods in effect.  
(f) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.  
Section2.03. [Reserved].  
Section2.04. [Reserved].  
85  
Section2.05. Prepayments.  
(a) Optional.  
(i) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (1)such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time)(A)three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B)one Business Day prior to any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (2)any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (3)any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment, the Tranche of Loans to be prepaid, the Type(s)of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s)of such Loans (except that if the class of Loans to be prepaid includes both Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans, absent direction by the Borrower, the applicable prepayment shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof before application to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case in a manner that minimizes the amount payable by the Borrower in respect of such prepayment pursuant to Section3.05). The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender’s ratable share of the relevant Tranche). If such notice is given by the Borrower, subject to clause (iii)below, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section2.05(a)(iv)and Section3.05. Each prepayment of outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section2.05(a)shall be applied to the applicable Tranche of Term Loans and to the principal repayment installments thereof as directed by the Borrower (and absent any such direction, in direct order of maturity thereof); and each such prepayment shall be paid to the Appropriate Lenders on a pro rata basis.  
(ii) [Reserved].  
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any such notice of prepayment pursuant to Section2.05(a)(i) may state that it is conditioned upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event specified therein (including the effectiveness of other credit facilities), in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  
86  
(iv) If the Borrower (A)(x)makes a voluntary prepayment of any Initial Term Loans pursuant to Section2.05(a) pursuant to a Repricing Transaction or (y)makes a prepayment of Initial Term Loans pursuant to Section2.05(b)(iii) pursuant to a Repricing Transaction, in each case prior to the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date in connection with any Repricing Transaction, or (B)effects any amendment of this Agreement resulting in a Repricing Transaction prior to the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of the applicable Term Lenders, a prepayment premium (i)in the case of clause (A)above, in an amount equal to 1.0% of the principal amount prepaid or (ii)in the case of clause (B)above, an amount equal to 1.0% of the principal amount of Initial Term Loans outstanding immediately prior to such amendment; provided that if any applicable Lender shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender for failing to consent to the amendment referred to in clause (B)above and all or any portion of its Initial Term Loans are assigned to another Lender pursuant to Section3.07(b) due to such failure, the Borrower shall pay such Non-Consenting Lender a fee equal to 1.0% of the principal amount of the Initial Term Loans so assigned by such Non-Consenting Lender; provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt, such fee shall be paid to the Non-Consenting Lender so replaced and not the replacement Lender. Such amounts shall be due and payable on the date of the effectiveness of such Repricing Transactions.  
(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section2.05(a), any Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower, elect to accept Rollover Indebtedness in lieu of all or part of such Lender’s pro rata portion of any prepayment of Term Loans, made pursuant to this Section2.05(a).  
(vi) Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, so long as no Default known to the Borrower or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may prepay the outstanding Term Loans on the following basis:  
(A) The Borrower shall have the right to make a voluntary prepayment of Term Loans at a discount to par (such prepayment, the “Discounted Term Loan Prepayment”) pursuant to a Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment, a Borrower Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers, or a Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, in each case made in accordance with this Section2.05(a)(vi); provided that the Borrower shall not initiate any action under this Section2.05(a)(vi) in order to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment unless (1)at least ten (10)Business Days shall have  
87  
 passed since the consummation of the most recent Discounted Term Loan Prepayment as a result of a prepayment made by the Borrower on the applicable Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, (2)at least three (3)Business Days shall have passed since the date the Borrower was notified that no Lender was willing to accept any prepayment of any Term Loan at the Specified Discount, within the Discount Range or at any discount to par value, as applicable, or in the case of Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, the date of the Borrower’s election not to accept any Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers made by a Lender pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi) or (3)if any other Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment, Borrower Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers, or a Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers is then outstanding. Any Term Loans prepaid pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi) shall be immediately and automatically cancelled.  
(B) Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment.  
(a) Subject to the proviso to subsection (A)above, the Borrower may from time to time offer to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by providing the Administrative Agent with three (3)Business Days’ notice in the form of a Specified Discount Prepayment Notice; provided that (I)any such offer shall be made available, at the sole discretion of the Borrower, to each Lender or to each Lender with respect to any Tranche on an individual Tranche basis, (II) any such offer shall specify the aggregate Outstanding Amount offered to be prepaid (the “Specified Discount Prepayment Amount”), the Tranches of Term Loans subject to such offer and the specific percentage discount to par value (the “Specified Discount”) of the Outstanding Amount of such Term Loans to be prepaid, (III) the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 and whole increments of $1,000,000 and (IV) each such offer shall remain outstanding through the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date. The Administrative Agent will promptly provide each relevant Lender with a copy of such Specified Discount Prepayment Notice and a form of the Specified Discount Prepayment Response to be completed and returned by each such Lender to the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 P.M., New York time, on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the relevant Lenders (or such later date designated by the Administrative Agent and approved by the Borrower) (the “Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date”).  
88  
(b) Each relevant Lender receiving such offer shall notify the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date whether or not it agrees to accept a prepayment of any of its relevant then outstanding Term Loans at the Specified Discount and, if so (such accepting Lender, a “Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender”), the amount of such Lender’s Outstanding Amount and Tranches of Term Loans to be prepaid at such offered discount. Each acceptance of a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by a Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender shall be irrevocable. Any Lender whose Specified Discount Prepayment Response is not received by the Administrative Agent by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept such Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment.  
(c) If there is at least one Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender, the Borrower will make prepayment of outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi)(B) to each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender in accordance with the respective Outstanding Amount and Tranches of Term Loans specified in such Lender’s Specified Discount Prepayment Response given pursuant to the foregoing clause(b); provided that, if the aggregate Outstanding Amount of Term Loans accepted for prepayment by all Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders exceeds the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount, such prepayment shall be made pro rata among the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders in accordance with the respective Outstanding Amounts accepted to be prepaid by each such Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender and the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the “Specified Discount Proration”). The Administrative Agent shall promptly, and in any case within three Business Days following the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date, notify (I)the Borrower of the respective Lenders’ responses to such offer, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the Tranches to be prepaid, (II)each Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, and the aggregate Outstanding Amount and the Tranches of all Term Loans to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date, and (III)each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender of the Specified Discount Proration, if any, and confirmation of the  
89  
 Outstanding Amount, Tranche and Type of Term Loans of such Lender to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Borrower and Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrower shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with Section2.05(a)(vi)(F) below (subject to Section2.05(a)(vi)(J) below).  
(C) Borrower Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers.  
(a) Subject to the proviso to subsection (A)above, the Borrower may from time to time solicit Discount Range Prepayment Offers by providing the Administrative Agent with three Business Days’ notice in the form of a Discount Range Prepayment Notice; provided that (I)any such solicitation shall be extended, at the sole discretion of the Borrower, to each Lender or to each Lender with respect to any Tranche on an individual Tranche basis, (II) any such notice shall specify the maximum aggregate Outstanding Amount of the relevant Term Loans that the Borrower is willing to prepay at a discount (the “Discount Range Prepayment Amount”), the Tranches of Term Loans subject to such offer and the maximum and minimum percentage discounts to par (the “Discount Range”) of the Outstanding Amount of such Term Loans willing to be prepaid by the Borrower, (III) the Discount Range Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 and whole increments of $1,000,000 and (IV) each such solicitation by the Borrower shall remain outstanding through the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date. The Administrative Agent will promptly provide each relevant Lender with a copy of such Discount Range Prepayment Notice and a form of the Discount Range Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding relevant Lender to the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 P.M., New York time, on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the relevant Lenders (or such later date as may be designated by the Administrative Agent and approved by the Borrower) (the “Discount Range Prepayment Response Date”). Each relevant Lender’s Discount Range Prepayment Offer shall be irrevocable and shall specify a discount to par within the Discount Range (the “Submitted Discount”) at which such Lender  
90  
 is willing to allow prepayment of any or all of its then outstanding Term Loans and the maximum aggregate Outstanding Amount and Tranches of such Term Loans such Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Submitted Discount (the “Submitted Amount”). Any Lender whose Discount Range Prepayment Offer is not received by the Administrative Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any discount to their par value within the Discount Range.  
(b) The Administrative Agent shall review all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by it by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date and will determine (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) the Applicable Discount and Term Loans to be prepaid at such Applicable Discount in accordance with this Section2.05(a)(vi)(C). The Borrower agrees to accept on the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by Administrative Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, in the order from the Submitted Discount that is the largest discount to par to the Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par, up to and including the Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par within the Discount Range (such Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par being referred to as the “Applicable Discount”) which yields a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment in an aggregate Outstanding Amount equal to the lesser of (I)the Discount Range Prepayment Amount and (II) the sum of all Submitted Amounts. Each Lender that has submitted a Discount Range Prepayment Offer to accept prepayment at a discount to par that is larger than or equal to the Applicable Discount shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term Loans equal to its Submitted Amount (subject to any required proration pursuant to the following Section2.05(a)(vi)(C)(c)) at the Applicable Discount (each such Lender, a “Participating Lender”).  
(c) If there is at least one Participating Lender, the Borrower will prepay the respective outstanding Term Loans of each Participating Lender in the aggregate Outstanding Amount and of the Tranches specified in such Lender’s Discount Range Prepayment Offer at the Applicable Discount; provided that if the Submitted Amount by all Participating Lenders offered at a  
91  
 discount to par greater than the Applicable Discount exceeds the Discount Range Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the Outstanding Amount of the relevant Term Loans for those Participating Lenders whose Submitted Discount is a discount to par greater than or equal to the Applicable Discount (the “Identified Participating Lenders”) shall be made pro rata among the Identified Participating Lenders in accordance with the Submitted Amount of each such Identified Participating Lender and the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the “Discount Range Proration”). The Administrative Agent shall promptly, and in any case within three (3)Business Days following the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, notify (w)the Borrower of the respective Lenders’ responses to such solicitation, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the Tranches to be prepaid, (x)each Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate Outstanding Amount and Tranches of all Term Loans to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (y)each Participating Lender of the aggregate Outstanding Amount and Tranches of such Lender to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, and (z)if applicable, each Identified Participating Lender of the Discount Range Proration. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Borrower and Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrower shall be due and payable by such Borrower on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with Section2.05(a)(vi)(F) below (subject to Section2.05(a)(vi)(J) below).  
(D) Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers.  
(a) Subject to the proviso to subsection (A)above, the Borrower may from time to time solicit Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers by providing the Administrative Agent with three Business Days’ notice in the form of a Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice; provided that (I)any such solicitation shall be extended, at the sole discretion of the Borrower, to each Lender or to each Lender with respect to any Tranche on an individual Tranche basis, (II) any such notice shall specify the maximum  
92  
 aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Term Loans and the Tranches of Term Loans the Borrower is willing to prepay at a discount (the “Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount”), (III) the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 and whole increments of $1,000,000, and (IV) each such solicitation by the Borrower shall remain outstanding through the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date. The Administrative Agent will promptly provide each relevant Lender with a copy of such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice and a form of the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding Lender to the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 P.M., New York time on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the relevant Lenders (or such later date as may be designated by the Administrative Agent and approved by Borrower) (the “Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date”). Each Lender’s Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer shall (x)be irrevocable, (y)remain outstanding until the Acceptance Date, and (z)specify both a discount to par (the “Offered Discount”) at which such Lender is willing to allow prepayment of its then outstanding Term Loans and the maximum aggregate Outstanding Amount and Tranches of such Term Loans (the “Offered Amount”) such Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Offered Discount. Any Lender whose Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer is not received by the Administrative Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any discount to their par value.  
(b) The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Borrower with a copy of all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by it by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date. The Borrower shall review all such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers and select, at its sole discretion, the smallest of the Offered Discounts specified by the relevant responding Lenders in the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers that the Borrower is willing to accept (the “Acceptable Discount”), if any, provided that the Acceptable Discount shall not be an Offered Discount that is larger than the smallest Offered Discount for which the sum of all Offered Amounts affiliated with Offered Discounts that are larger than or equal to such smallest Offered Discount would, if purchased at such smallest Offered Discount, yield an amount at least equal to the Solicited Discounted  
93  
 Prepayment Amount. If the Borrower elects to accept any Offered Discount as the Acceptable Discount, then as soon as practicable after the determination of the Acceptable Discount, but in no event later than by the third Business Day after the date of receipt by the Borrower from the Administrative Agent of a copy of all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers pursuant to the first sentence of this clause(2) (the “Acceptance Date”), the Borrower shall submit an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice to the Administrative Agent setting forth the Acceptable Discount. If the Administrative Agent shall fail to receive an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice from the Borrower by the Acceptance Date, the Borrower shall be deemed to have rejected all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers.  
(c) Based upon the Acceptable Discount and the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by Administrative Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date, within three Business Days after receipt of an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice (the “Discounted Prepayment Determination Date”), the Administrative Agent will determine (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) the aggregate Outstanding Amount and the Tranches of Term Loans (the “Acceptable Prepayment Amount”) to be prepaid by the Borrower at the Acceptable Discount in accordance with this Section2.05(a)(vi)(D). If the Borrower elects to accept any Acceptable Discount, then the Borrower agrees to accept all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by the Administrative Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date, in the order from largest Offered Discount to smallest Offered Discount, up to and including the Acceptable Discount. Each Lender that has submitted a Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer to accept prepayment at an Offered Discount that is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term Loans equal to its Offered Amount (subject to any required proration pursuant to the following sentence) at the Acceptable Discount (each such Lender, a “Qualifying Lender”). The Borrower will prepay outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi)(D) to each Qualifying Lender in the aggregate Outstanding Amount and of the Tranches specified in such Lender’s Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer at the Acceptable Discount; provided that if the aggregate Offered Amount by all  
94  
 Qualifying Lenders whose Offered Discount is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount exceeds the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the Outstanding Amount of the Term Loans for those Qualifying Lenders whose Offered Discount is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount (the “Identified Qualifying Lenders”) shall be made pro rata among the Identified Qualifying Lenders in accordance with the Offered Amount of each such Identified Qualifying Lender and the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the “Solicited Discount Proration”). On or prior to the Discounted Prepayment Determination Date, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify (w)the Borrower of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and Acceptable Prepayment Amount comprising the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the Tranches to be prepaid, (x)each Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Acceptable Discount, and the Acceptable Prepayment Amount of all Term Loans and the Tranches to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (y)each Qualifying Lender of the aggregate Outstanding Amount and the Tranches of such Lender to be prepaid at the Acceptable Discount on such date, and (z)if applicable, each Identified Qualifying Lender of the Solicited Discount Proration. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Borrower and Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrower shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with Section2.05(a)(vi)(F) below (subject to Section2.05(a)(vi)(J) below).  
(E) Expenses. In connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the Borrower and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that the Administrative Agent may require as a condition to any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses from the Borrower in connection therewith.  
(F) Payment. If any Term Loan is prepaid in accordance with Section2.05(a)(vi)(B) through (D)above, the Borrower shall prepay such Term Loans on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date. The Borrower shall make such prepayment to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders, Participating Lenders, or  
95  
 Qualifying Lenders, as applicable, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and all such prepayments shall be applied to the remaining principal installments of the Term Loans in inverse order of maturity. The Term Loans so prepaid shall be accompanied by all accrued and unpaid interest on the par principal amount so prepaid up to, but not including, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date. Each prepayment of the outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi) shall be paid to the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders, Participating Lenders, or Qualifying Lenders, as applicable. The aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Tranches of the Term Loans outstanding shall be deemed reduced by the full par value of the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Tranches of Term Loans prepaid on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment. The Lenders hereby agree that, in connection with a prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi) and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)interest in respect of the Term Loans may be made on a non-pro rata basis among the Lenders holding such Term Loans to reflect the payment of accrued interest to certain Lenders as provided in this Section2.05(a)(vi)(F) and (B)all subsequent prepayments and repayments of the Term Loans (except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement) shall be made on a pro rata basis among the respective Lenders based upon the then outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans then held by the respective Lenders after giving effect to any prepayment pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi) as if made at par. It is also understood and agreed that prepayments pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi) shall not be subject to Section2.05(a)(i).  
(G) Other Procedures. To the extent not expressly provided for herein, each Discounted Term Loan Prepayment shall be consummated pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions in this Section2.05(a)(vi), established by the Administrative Agent acting in its reasonable discretion and as reasonably agreed by the Borrower.  
96  
(H) Notice. Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, for purposes of this Section2.05(a)(vi), each notice or other communication required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) shall be deemed to have been given upon the Administrative Agent’s (or its delegate’s) actual receipt during normal business hours of such notice or communication; provided that any notice or communication actually received outside of normal business hours shall be deemed to have been given as of the opening of business on the next Business Day.  
(I) Actions of Administrative Agent. Each of the Borrower and the Lenders acknowledges and agrees that Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties under this Section2.05(a)(vi) by itself or through any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent and expressly consents to any such delegation of duties by the Administrative Agent to such Affiliate and the performance of such delegated duties by such Affiliate. The exculpatory provisions in this Agreement shall apply to each Affiliate of the Administrative Agent and its respective activities in connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment provided for in this Section2.05(a)(vi) as well as to activities of the Administrative Agent in connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment provided for in this Section2.05(a)(vi).  
(J) Revocation. The Borrower shall have the right, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, to revoke in full (but not in part) its offer to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and rescind the applicable Specified Discount Prepayment Notice, Discount Range Prepayment Notice or Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice therefor at its discretion at any time on or prior to the applicable Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date (and if such offer is so revoked, any failure by the Borrower to make any prepayment to a Lender pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi) shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default under Section8.01 or otherwise).  
(K) No Obligation. This Section2.05(a)(vi) shall not (i)require the Borrower to undertake any prepayment pursuant to this Section2.05(a)(vi) or (ii)limit or restrict the Borrower from making voluntary prepayments of the Term Loans in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.  
(b) Mandatory.  
(i) Within 10 Business Days after financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section6.01(a)and the related Compliance Certificate has  
97  
 been delivered pursuant to Section6.02(b), the Borrower shall prepay, subject to Section2.05(d), an aggregate principal amount of Term Loans in an amount equal to (A)the ECF Percentage of Excess Cash Flow, if any, for such Fiscal Year (commencing with the Fiscal Year ended on December27, 2015), minus (B)the sum of(1)the amount of any cash prepayments of the Term Loans made pursuant to Section2.05(a)during such Fiscal Year, including any prepayment at a discount to par pursuant to Section2.05(a)(vi) in an amount not to exceed the actual cash amount of such prepayment (and, in each case, not previously applied by the Borrower in such Fiscal Year pursuant to the following clause (2)to reduce the prepayment required by this Section2.05(b)(i)for the preceding Fiscal Year), (2)at the Borrower’s election, all or any amount of any cash prepayment of the Term Loans made pursuant to Section2.05(a)after the end of such Fiscal Year and on or prior to the date of such prepayment, including any prepayment at a discount to par pursuant to Section2.05(a)(vi) in an amount not to exceed the actual cash amount of such prepayment, (3)solely to the extent the Incremental Revolving Commitments are reduced in connection therewith (and solely to the extent of the amount of such reduction), the amount of any cash prepayments of the Incremental Revolving Credit Loans (if any) during such Fiscal Year (and not previously applied by the Borrower in such Fiscal Year pursuant to the following clause (4)to reduce the prepayment required by this Section2.05(b)(i) for the preceding Fiscal Year), (4)solely to the extent the Incremental Revolving Commitments are reduced in connection therewith (and solely to the extent of the amount of such reduction), at the Borrower’s election, all or any amount of any cash prepayment of the Incremental Revolving Credit Loans (if any) after the end of such Fiscal Year and on or prior to the date of such prepayment, (5)solely to the extent the commitments of the ABL Lenders under the ABL Facility Agreement are reduced in connection therewith (and solely to the extent of the amount of such reduction), the amount of any cash prepayments of any indebtedness under the ABL Facility Agreement during such Fiscal Year (and not previously applied by the Borrower in such Fiscal Year pursuant to the following clause (6)to reduce the prepayment required by this Section2.05(b)(i) for the preceding Fiscal Year), (6)solely to the extent the commitments of the ABL Lenders under the ABL Facility Agreement are reduced in connection therewith (and solely to the extent of the amount of such reduction), at the Borrower’s election, all or any amount of any cash prepayment of any indebtedness under the ABL Facility Agreement after the end of such Fiscal Year and on or prior to the date of such prepayment, (7)the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans (including Incremental Term Loans) repaid pursuant to Section2.07 during such Fiscal Year, and (8)the portion of the Excess Cash Flow applied or offered (to the extent the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary is required by the terms thereof)to prepay, repay or purchase other Indebtedness that is secured by the Term Loan Priority Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Obligations to the extent such other Indebtedness and the Liens securing the same are permitted  
98  
 hereunder and the documentation governing such other Indebtedness requires such a prepayment or repurchase thereof with Excess Cash Flow, in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (x)the amount of Excess Cash Flow and (y)a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such other Indebtedness and the denominator of which is the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans and all such other Indebtedness (such amount under this clause (7), the “Pari Passu ECF Amount”); provided that in each case under clauses (B)(1) through (6)above, no voluntary prepayment funded with the proceeds of an incurrence of Indebtedness with a maturity date more than twelve months from the date of incurrence thereof (other than Incremental Revolving Credit Loans, loans under the ABL Facility or loans under any other revolving facility available to the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) may be applied pursuant to clauses (B)(1) through 6 above to reduce the amount of the prepayment required under this Section2.05(b)(i); provided, further, that the prepayment set forth in this subsection 2.05(b)(i) shall apply solely to the extent that after giving effect thereto, the Available Liquidity of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall equal or exceed $75,000,000.  
(ii) (A) If (x)the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary Disposes of any property or assets (other than any Disposition (1)to a Loan Party, (2)by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party, to another Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party or (3)of ABL Priority Collateral to the extent the Net Cash Proceeds of such Disposition are required to be applied to the payment of ABL Facility Obligations) pursuant to Section7.05(e), (p), (s), (t), (u), (v)or (to the extent required pursuant to the definition of “Asset Swap Transaction”) (x)or (y)any Casualty Event occurs, and any transaction or series of related transactions described in the foregoing clauses (x)and (y)results in the receipt by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary of aggregate Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $10,000,000 in any Fiscal Year (any such transaction or series of related transactions resulting in Net Cash Proceeds being a “Relevant Transaction”), subject to Section2.05(d), the Borrower shall (1)give written notice to the Administrative Agent thereof promptly after the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds and (2)except to the extent the Borrower elects in such notice to reinvest all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with Section2.05(b)(ii)(B), within 15 Business Days of receipt thereof by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, prepay an aggregate principal amount of Term Loans in an amount equal to (A)the Net Cash Proceeds received from such Relevant Transaction minus (B)the portion of the Net Cash Proceeds received from such Relevant Transaction applied or offered to prepay or repurchase any other Indebtedness that is secured by the Term Loan Priority Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Obligations to the extent such other Indebtedness and the Liens securing the same are permitted hereunder and the documentation governing such other Indebtedness requires such an application or offer of  
99  
 prepayment or repurchase thereof with the proceeds of such Relevant Transaction, in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (1)the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds and (2)a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such other Indebtedness and the denominator of which is the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans and all such other Indebtedness (such amount under this clause (B), the “Pari Passu Disposition Amount”).  
(B) With respect to any Net Cash Proceeds realized or received with respect to any Relevant Transaction at the option of the Borrower, the Borrower may reinvest all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in the business of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including to make Investments permitted by Section7.02) within 540 days following receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (or, if the Borrower or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, has contractually committed within 540 days following receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds to reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, then within 720 days following receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds); provided, that if any of such Net Cash Proceeds are no longer intended to be so reinvested at any time after the occurrence of the Relevant Transaction (or are not reinvested within such 540 days or 720 days, as applicable), an amount equal to any such Net Cash Proceeds shall be promptly applied to the prepayment of the Term Loans as set forth in this Section2.05(b)(ii).  
(iii) Upon the incurrence or issuance by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Refinancing Indebtedness, any Specified Refinancing Term Loans or any Indebtedness not expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section7.03, the Borrower shall prepay the Term Loans (or, in the case of the incurrence or issuance of any Refinancing Indebtedness or Specified Refinancing Term Loans, the Tranche of Term Loans being refinanced), in an amount equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom immediately upon receipt thereof by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary.  
(iv) [Reserved].  
(v) [Reserved].  
(vi) Each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section2.05(b) shall be applied ratably among the Term Lenders (or, in the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section2.05(b)(iii) upon the issuance or incurrence of Refinancing Indebtedness or Specified Refinancing Term Loans, ratably among the Term Lenders of the Tranche of Term Loans being prepaid) to the principal repayment installments of the Term Loans (or Tranche thereof) that are due pursuant to Section2.07(a) as directed by the Borrower (and absent any such direction, in  
100  
 direct order of maturity thereof). Each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section2.05(b)shall be applied on a pro rata basis to each Tranche of Term Loans (other than in the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section2.05(b)(iii) upon the issuance or incurrence of Refinancing Indebtedness or Specified Refinancing Term Loans) and to the then outstanding Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans under such Tranche; provided that, (x)at the request of the Borrower, in lieu of such application on a pro rata basis among all Tranches of Term Loans, such prepayment may be applied to any Tranche of Term Loans so long as the maturity date of such Tranche of Term Loans precedes the maturity date of each other Tranche of Term Loans then outstanding or, in the event more than one Tranche of Term Loans shall have an identical maturity date that precedes the maturity date of each other Tranche of Term Loans then outstanding, to such Tranches on a pro rata basis and shall be applied within each Tranche of Term Loans and (y)if there are no Declining Lenders with respect to such prepayment, then the amount thereof shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans under such Tranche to the full extent thereof before application to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case in a manner that minimizes the amount payable by the Borrower in respect of such prepayment pursuant to Section3.05.  
(vii) All prepayments under this Section2.05 shall be made together with, in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period therefor, any amounts owing in respect of such Eurodollar Rate Loan pursuant to Section3.05, and, to the extent applicable, any additional amounts required pursuant to Section2.05(a)(iv).  
(viii) [Reserved].  
(ix) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section2.05(b), any Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower, elect to accept Rollover Indebtedness in lieu of all or part of such Lender’s pro rata portion of any prepayment of Term Loans, made pursuant to Section2.05(b)(iii).  
(c) Term Lender Opt-Out. With respect to any prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section2.05(b)(i) or (ii), the Borrower may elect, at its option, to allow the Term Lenders to decline to accept the applicable prepayment. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any event giving rise to a prepayment under Section2.05(b)(i) or (ii)at least 10 Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify the expected date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment that is required to be made under Section2.05(b)(i) or (ii)(the “Prepayment Amount”) and whether or not the Borrower has elected to allow the Term Lenders to decline to accept such prepayment. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the contents of any such prepayment notice so received from the Borrower, including the date on which such prepayment is to be made (the “Prepayment Date”). If the Borrower has elected to  
101  
 allow the Term Lenders to decline to accept a prepayment, any Appropriate Lender may decline to accept all (but not less than all) of its share of any such prepayment (any such Lender, a “Declining Lender”) by providing written notice to the Administrative Agent no later than five Business Days after the date of such Appropriate Lender’s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such prepayment. If any Appropriate Lender does not give a notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such fifth Business Day informing the Administrative Agent that it declines to accept the applicable prepayment, then such Lender will be deemed to have accepted such prepayment. On any Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Prepayment Amount minus the portion thereof allocable to Declining Lenders, in each case for such Prepayment Date, shall be paid to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower and applied by the Administrative Agent ratably to prepay Term Loans owing to Appropriate Lenders (other than Declining Lenders) in the manner described in Section2.05(b) for such prepayment. Any amounts that would otherwise have been applied to prepay Term Loans owing to Declining Lenders shall be retained by the Borrower (such amounts, “Term Loan Declined Amounts”).  
(d) Repatriation Issues. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section2.05, (i)to the extent that any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Disposition by a Restricted Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to a mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section2.05(b)(ii)(a “Foreign Asset Sale”), the Net Cash Proceeds of any Casualty Event from a Restricted Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Recovery Event”)or Excess Cash Flow, are prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times provided in this Section2.05 but may be retained by the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Borrower hereby agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all actions required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be immediately effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow will be promptly (and in any event not later than two Business Days after such repatriation)applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof)to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section2.05(b)and (ii)to the extent that the Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Asset Sale, any Foreign Recovery Event or Excess Cash Flow would have a material adverse tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, the Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected may be retained by the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary; provided that, in the case of this clause (ii), on or before the date on which any Net Cash Proceeds from any Foreign Asset Sale or Foreign Recovery Event so retained would otherwise have been required to be applied to reinvestments or  
102  
 prepayments pursuant to Section2.05(b)(ii)(or, in the case of Excess Cash Flow, a date on or before the date that is twelve months after the date such Excess Cash Flow would have so required to be applied to prepayments pursuant to Section2.05(b)(i)unless previously repatriated in which case such repatriated Excess Cash Flow shall have been promptly applied to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section2.05(b)(i)), (x)the Borrower applies an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to such reinvestments or prepayments as if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been received by the Borrower rather than such Restricted Foreign Subsidiary, less the amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated (or, if less, the Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow that would be calculated if received by such Foreign Subsidiary)or (y)such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow are applied to the repayment of Indebtedness of a Restricted Foreign Subsidiary or, in the case of such Net Cash Proceeds, by such Restricted Foreign Subsidiary to make Investments.  
Section2.06. Termination or Reduction of Commitments.  
(a) Optional. (i)The Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the unused portions of the Term Commitments (if any), or from time to time permanently reduce the unused portions of the Term Commitments (if any); provided that (x)any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent three Business Days (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent shall agree)prior to the date of termination or reduction, and (y)any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  
(ii) Any such notice of termination or reduction of commitments pursuant to Section2.06(a)(i) may state that it is conditioned upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event specified therein (including the effectiveness of other credit facilities), in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  
(b) Mandatory.  
The aggregate Term Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced to zero on the earlier to occur of (A)the date of the Term Borrowing and (B)the Termination Date.  
(c) Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the Term Commitments under this Section2.06. Upon any reduction of the Commitments under a Facility, the Commitment of each Lender under such Facility shall be reduced by such Lender’s ratable share of the amount by which such Facility is  
103  
 reduced (other than the termination of the Commitment of any Lender as provided in Section3.07). All commitment fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments and unpaid, shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.  
Section2.07. Repayment of Loans.  
Term Loans. Beginning with December28, 2014, the Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Term Lenders the aggregate principal amount of all Initial Term Loans outstanding in consecutive quarterly installments on the dates (or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) as follows (which installments shall, to the extent applicable, be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Sections2.05 and 2.06, or be increased as a result of any increase in the amount of Initial Term Loans pursuant to Section2.14 (such increased amortization payments to be calculated in the same manner (and on the same basis)as the schedule set forth below for the Initial Term Loans made as of the Closing Date)):  
Date 
Amount 
Each March31,June30,September30 and December31 ending prior to the Maturity Date for the Term Facility 
1.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the aggregate initial principal amount of the Initial Term Loans on the Closing Date 
Maturity Date for the Term Facility 
all unpaid aggregate principal amounts of any outstanding Initial Term Loans  
Section2.08. Interest.  
(a) Subject to the provisions of Section2.08(b), (i)each Eurodollar Rate Loan under a Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (A)the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus (B)the Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate Loans under such Facility and (ii)each Base Rate Loan under a Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date or conversion date, as the case may be, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (A)the Base Rate plus (B)the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans under such Facility.  
(b) The Borrower shall pay interest on all overdue Obligations hereunder, which shall include all Obligations following an acceleration pursuant to Section8.02 (including an automatic acceleration)at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times  
104  
 equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest)shall be due and payable upon demand.  
(c) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein; provided that in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.  
Section2.09. Fees.  
(a) [Reserved].  
(b) (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own respective account a fee in the amount and at the times specified in the final paragraph of Section1 of the JPM Fee Letter.  
(ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.  
Section2.10. Computation of Interest and Fees.  
(a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  
(b) [Reserved].  
Section2.11. Evidence of Indebtedness.  
(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section10.07(c),  
105  
 in each case in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent)a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.  
(b) [Reserved].  
(c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section2.11(a)and by each Lender in its accounts or records pursuant to Section2.11(a)shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such accounts or records, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such accounts or records shall not limit the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  
Section2.12. Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.  
(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 4:00 p.m. (New York City time)on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable share in respect of the relevant Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein)of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 4:00 p.m. (New York City time)shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case  
106  
 may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  
(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York City time)on the date of such Borrowing)that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with and at the time required by Section2.02(b)and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if any Lender does not in fact make its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand an amount equal to such applicable share in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A)in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing and (B)in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If both the Borrower and such Lender pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make its share of any Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent.  
(ii) Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower does not in fact make such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the  
107  
 date such amount is distributed by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.  
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section2.12(b)shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  
(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this ArticleII, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in ArticleIV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender)to such Lender on demand, without interest.  
(d) Obligations of the Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section9.07 are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section9.07 on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or, to fund its participation or to make its payment under Section9.07.  
(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.  
(f) Insufficient Funds. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)first, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)second, toward payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.  
(g) Unallocated Funds. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance  
108  
 with such Lender’s ratable share of the sum of the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender.  
Section2.13. Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise)in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder)thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a)notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b)purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)the amount of such paying Lender’s required repayment to (ii)the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender)of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section10.09)with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error)of participations purchased under this Section2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Sectionshall not be construed to apply to (A)[reserved], (B)the assignments and participations (including by means of a Dutch auction or similar procedures as set forth in Section2.05(a)(vi))described in Section10.07, (C)the incurrence of any Rollover Indebtedness in accordance with Section2.05(a)(v) or Section2.05(b)(ix), any Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Loans in accordance with Section2.14, any Specified Refinancing Debt in accordance with Section2.20, any Extension in accordance with Section2.15 and any Permitted Debt Exchange Notes in accordance with Section2.16, (D)any loan modification offer described in Section10.01 or (E)any applicable circumstances contemplated by Section3.07.  
109  
Section2.14. Incremental Facilities.   
(a) So long as no Event of Default exists or would arise therefrom, the Borrower shall have the right, at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, (i)to request new term loan commitments under one or more new term loan credit facilities to be included in this Agreement (the commitments thereunder, the “Incremental Term Loan Commitments” and each a “New Term Facility”), (ii)to increase the existing Term Loans by requesting new term loan commitments to be added to an existing Tranche of Term Loans (the “Supplemental Term Loan Commitments”), (iii)to request new commitments under one or more new revolving facilities to be included in this Agreement (the “Incremental Revolving Commitments”), (iv)to increase any Incremental Revolving Commitments by requesting new revolving credit commitments to be added to an existing Tranche of Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments (the “Supplemental Revolving Commitments”) and (v)to request new letter of credit facility commitments under one or more new letter of credit facilities to be included in this Agreement (the “Incremental Letter of Credit Commitments” and, together with the Incremental Term Loan Commitments, the Supplemental Term Loan Commitments, the Incremental Revolving Commitments, the Supplemental Revolving Commitments and the “Incremental Commitments”) by an amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount (at the time of incurrence or establishment of such Incremental Commitment). Any loans made in respect of any such Incremental Commitment (other than Supplemental Term Loan Commitments and Supplemental Revolving Commitments)shall be made by creating a new Tranche. Each Incremental Commitment made available pursuant to this Section2.14 shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of at least $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such lesser amounts as the Administrative Agent may agree).  
(b) Each request from the Borrower pursuant to this Section2.14 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Commitments. The Incremental Commitments (or any portion thereof)may be made by any existing Lender or by any other bank or financial institution (other than any Disqualified Lender) (any such bank or other financial institution, an “Additional Lender”); provided that, if such Additional Lender is not already a Lender hereunder or an Affiliate of a Lender hereunder, such Additional Lender shall be subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the extent required pursuant to Section10.07 (it being understood that any such Additional Lender that is an Affiliate Lender shall be subject to the provisions of Section10.07(i), mutatis mutandis, to the same extent as if such Incremental Commitments and related Obligations had been obtained by such Lender by way of assignment).  
(c) Supplemental Term Loan Commitments and Supplemental Revolving Commitments shall become commitments under this Agreement pursuant to a supplement specifying the Tranche of Term Loans or Tranche of Incremental Revolving  
110  
 Loans, as applicable, to be increased, executed by the Borrower and each increasing Lender substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit M-1 (the “Increase Supplement”)or by each Additional Lender substantially in the form attached hereto as ExhibitM-2 (the “Lender Joinder Agreement”), as the case may be, which shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent for recording in the Register pursuant to which such Lender or Additional Lender agrees to commit to all or a portion of such Incremental Commitment, and in the case of an Additional Lender, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a Lender. The Borrower may agree to accept a lesser amount of any Incremental Commitment than originally requested. In the event there are Lenders and Additional Lenders that have committed to an Incremental Commitment in excess of the maximum amount requested (or permitted), then the Borrower shall have the right to allocate such commitments on whatever basis the Borrower determines is appropriate. Upon effectiveness of the Lender Joinder Agreement each Additional Lender shall be a Lender for all intents and purposes of this Agreement and the term loan made pursuant to such Supplemental Term Loan Commitment shall be a Term Loan and the Supplemental Revolving Commitment shall be an Incremental Revolving Commitment.  
(d) Incremental Commitments (other than Supplemental Term Loan Commitments and Supplemental Revolving Commitments) shall become commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an “Incremental Commitment Amendment”)to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Additional Lender and the Administrative Agent. An Incremental Commitment Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lender, effect such amendments to any Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section2.14 (including, without limitation, with respect to any Incremental Commitments to be secured on a junior basis by the Collateral, appropriate modifications, if any, to Sections2.05(b)(vi), 8.02 and 8.04 of this Agreement and to the Guaranty, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement), provided, however, that (i)(A)the Incremental Commitments will not be guaranteed by any Subsidiary of the Borrower other than the Guarantors, and will be secured on a pari passu or (at the Borrower’s option) junior basis by the same Collateral securing the Loans (so long as any such Incremental Commitments (and related Obligations)are subject to the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement or an Other Intercreditor Agreement, including a Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable), (B)the Incremental Commitments and any incremental loans drawn thereunder (the “Incremental Loans”)shall rank pari passu in right of payment with or (at the Borrower’s option) junior to the Loans and (C)no Incremental Commitment Amendment may provide for any Incremental Commitment or any Incremental Loans to be secured by any Collateral or other assets of any Loan Party that do not also secure the Loans; (ii)no Lender will be required to provide any such Incremental Commitment unless it so agrees; (iii)in the case of a New Term Facility, the maturity date and the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Incremental Commitments shall be no earlier than or shorter than, as the case may be, the Maturity  
111  
 Date or the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Initial Term Loans, as applicable; (iv)the interest rate margins, (subject to Section2.14(d)(iii)) amortization schedule, original issue discount (“OID”), upfront fees and interest rate floors applicable to the loans made pursuant to the New Term Facilities or Incremental Revolving Facilities shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable Additional Lenders; provided that in the event that the applicable interest rate margins for any Incremental Term Loans incurred by the Borrower under any New Term Facilities are higher than the applicable interest rate margin for the Initial Term Loans by more than 25 basis points, then the Applicable Rate for the Initial Term Loans shall be increased to the extent necessary so that the applicable interest rate margin for the Initial Term Loans is equal to the applicable interest rate margins for such New Term Facilities minus 25 basis points; provided, further, that in determining the applicable interest rate margins for the Initial Term Loans and the New Term Facilities, (A)OID or upfront fees payable generally to all participating Additional Lenders in lieu of OID (which shall be deemed to constitute like amounts of OID)payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under the Initial Term Loans or any New Term Facilities in the initial primary syndication thereof shall be included (with OID being equated to interest based on an assumed four-year life to maturity); (B)any arrangement, structuring or other fees payable in connection with the New Term Facilities that are not shared with all Additional Lenders providing such New Term Facilities shall be excluded; (C)any amendments to the Applicable Rate on the Initial Term Loans that became effective subsequent to the Closing Date but prior to the time of such New Term Facilities shall also be included in such calculations and (D)if the New Term Facilities include an interest rate floor greater than the interest rate floor applicable to the Initial Term Loans, such increased amount shall be equated to the applicable interest rate margin for purposes of determining whether an increase to the Applicable Rate for the Initial Term Loans shall be required, to the extent an increase in the interest rate floor for the Initial Term Loans would cause an increase in the interest rate then in effect thereunder, and in such case the interest rate floor (but not the Applicable Rate)applicable to the Initial Term Loans set forth in the last sentence of the definition of Eurodollar Rate and Base Rate, respectively, shall be increased by such amount; (v)such Incremental Commitment Amendment may (1)provide for the inclusion, as appropriate, of Additional Lenders in any required vote or action of the Required Lenders or of the Lenders of each Tranche hereunder, (2)provide class voting and other class protections for any additional credit facilities, (3)provide for adjustments to the definition of “Defaulting Lender” and add “Defaulting Lender” protections and (4)in the case of an Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment or Incremental Letter of Credit Commitment, add appropriate modifications to Section2.15 to provide for “amend and extend” mechanics for Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments or an Incremental Letter of Credit Commitment (and related Obligations) and appropriate modifications to Section2.20 to provide to “refinancing facilities” mechanics for Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and Incremental Letter of Credit Commitments (and related Obligations), in each case under this clause (4)and the preceding clause (3)on terms substantially similar to the equivalent terms in the ABL  
112  
 Facility Agreement as in effect on the date hereof (as determined in good faith by the Borrower); and (vi)the other terms and documentation in respect thereof, to the extent not consistent with this Agreement as in effect prior to giving effect to the Incremental Commitment Amendment, shall otherwise be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower, provided that, to the extent such terms and documentation are not consistent with, the terms and documentation governing the existing Loans (except to the extent permitted by clause (iii), (iv)or (v)above), they shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.  
Section2.15. Extension of Term Loans.  
(a) The Borrower may at any time and from time to time request that all or a portion of the Term Loans of one or more Tranches existing at the time of such request (each, an “Existing Term Tranche”, and the Term Loans of such Tranche, the “Existing Term Loans”), be converted to extend the scheduled maturity date(s)of any payment of principal with respect to all or a portion of any principal amount of any Existing Term Tranche (any such Existing Term Tranche which has been so extended, an “Extended Term Tranche”, and the Term Loan of such Extended Term Tranche, the “Extended Term Loan”) and to provide for other terms consistent with this Section2.15; provided that (i)any such request shall be made by the Borrower to all Lenders with Term Loans with a like maturity date (whether under one or more Tranches)on a pro rata basis (based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the applicable Term Loans) and (ii)any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied unless waived by the Borrower in its sole discretion. In order to establish any Extended Term Tranche, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders of the applicable Existing Term Tranche)(an “Extension Request”)setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Term Tranche to be established, which terms shall be substantially similar to those applicable to the Existing Term Tranche from which they are to be extended (the “Specified Existing Tranche”), except (x)all or any of the final maturity dates of such Extended Term Tranches shall be extended to later dates than the final maturity dates of the Specified Existing Tranche, (y)(A)the interest margins with respect to the Extended Term Tranche may be higher or lower than the interest margins for the Specified Existing Tranche and/or (B)additional fees may be payable to the Lenders providing such Extended Term Tranche in addition to or in lieu of any increased margins contemplated by the preceding clause (A)and (z)so long as the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Extended Term Tranche would be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Specified Existing Tranche, amortization rates with respect to the Extended Term Tranche may be higher or lower than the amortization rates for the Specified Existing Tranche, in each case to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section2.15 or otherwise, assignments and participations of Extended Term Tranches shall be governed by the same or, at the Borrower’s discretion, more restrictive  
113  
 assignment and participation provisions applicable to Initial Term Loans set forth in Section10.07. No Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Existing Term Loans converted into an Extended Term Tranche pursuant to any Extension Request. Any Extended Term Tranche shall constitute a separate Tranche of Loans from the Specified Existing Tranches and from any other Existing Term Tranches (together with any other Extended Term Tranches so established on such date).  
(b) The Borrower shall provide the applicable Extension Request at least ten (10)Business Days (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion) prior to the date on which Lenders under the applicable Existing Term Tranche or Existing Term Tranches are requested to respond. Any Lender (an “Extending Lender”) wishing to have all or a portion of its Specified Existing Tranche converted into an Extended Term Tranche shall notify the Administrative Agent (each, an “Extension Election”) on or prior to the date specified in such Extension Request of the amount of its Specified Existing Tranche that it has elected to convert into an Extended Term Tranche. In the event that the aggregate amount of the Specified Existing Tranche subject to Extension Elections exceeds the amount of Extended Term Tranches requested pursuant to the Extension Request, the Specified Existing Tranches subject to Extension Elections shall be converted to Extended Term Tranches on a pro rata basis based on the amount of Specified Existing Tranches included in each such Extension Election. In connection with any extension of Loans pursuant to this Section2.15 (each, an “Extension”), the Borrower shall agree to such procedures regarding timing, rounding and other administrative adjustments to ensure reasonable administrative management of the credit facilities hereunder after such Extension, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of this Section2.15. The Borrower may amend, revoke or replace an Extension Request pursuant to procedures reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent at any time prior to the date (the “Extension Request Deadline”) on which Lenders under the applicable Existing Term Tranche or Existing Term Tranches are requested to respond to the Extension Request. Any Lender may revoke an Extension Election at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. on the date that is two (2)Business Days prior to the Extension Request Deadline, at which point the Extension Request becomes irrevocable (unless otherwise agreed by Borrower). The revocation of an Extension Election prior to the Extension Request Deadline shall not prejudice any Lender’s right to submit a new Extension Election prior to the Extension Request Deadline.  
(c) Extended Term Tranches shall be established pursuant to an amendment (an “Extension Amendment”)to this Agreement (which may include amendments to provisions related to maturity, interest margins or fees referenced in clauses (x)and (y)of Section2.15(a), or amortization rates referenced in clause (z)of Section2.15(a), and which, in each case, except to the extent expressly contemplated by the last sentence of this Section2.15(c)and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section10.01, shall not require the consent of any Lender other than the Extending  
114  
 Lenders with respect to the Extended Term Tranches established thereby)executed by the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, and the Extending Lenders. Subject to the requirements of this Section2.15 and without limiting the generality or applicability of Section10.01 to any Section2.15 Additional Amendments, any Extension Amendment may provide for additional terms and/or additional amendments other than those referred to or contemplated above (any such additional amendment, a “Section2.15 Additional Amendment”)to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that such Section2.15 Additional Amendments do not become effective prior to the time that such Section2.15 Additional Amendments have been consented to (including, without limitation, pursuant to consents applicable to holders of any Extended Term Tranches provided for in any Extension Amendment)by such of the Lenders, Loan Parties and other parties (if any)as may be required in order for such Section2.15 Additional Amendments to become effective in accordance with Section10.01; provided, further, that no Extension Amendment may provide for (i)any Extended Term Tranche to be secured by any Collateral or other assets of any Loan Party that does not also secure the Existing Term Tranches or be guaranteed by any Person other than the Guarantors and (ii)so long as any Existing Term Tranches are outstanding, any mandatory prepayment provisions that do not also apply to the Existing Term Tranches (other than Existing Term Tranches secured on a junior basis by the Collateral or ranking junior in right of payment, which shall be subject to junior prepayment provisions)on a pro rata or otherwise more favorable basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section10.01, any such Extension Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to any Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section2.15; provided that the foregoing shall not constitute a consent on behalf of any Lender to the terms of any Section2.15 Additional Amendment.  
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, on any date on which any Existing Term Tranche is converted to extend the related scheduled maturity date(s)in accordance with clause (a)above (an “Extension Date”), in the case of the Specified Existing Tranche of each Extending Lender, the aggregate principal amount of such Specified Existing Tranche shall be deemed reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Extended Term Tranche so converted by such Lender on such date, and such Extended Term Tranches shall be established as a separate Tranche from the Specified Existing Tranche and from any other Existing Term Tranches (together with any other Extended Term Tranches so established on such date).  
(e) If, in connection with any proposed Extension Amendment, any Lender declines to consent to the applicable extension on the terms and by the deadline set forth in the applicable Extension Request (each such other Lender, a “Non-Extending Lender”)then the Borrower may, on notice to the Administrative Agent and the Non-Extending Lender, replace such Non-Extending Lender by causing such Lender to (and  
115  
 such Lender shall be obligated to)assign pursuant to Section10.07 (with the assignment fee and any other costs and expenses to be paid by the Borrower in such instance)all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more assignees; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement Lender; provided, further, that the applicable assignee shall have agreed to provide Extended Term Loans on the terms set forth in such Extension Amendment; provided, further, that all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Non-Extending Lender relating to the Existing Term Loans so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender to such Non-Extending Lender concurrently with such Assignment and Assumption. In connection with any such replacement under this Section2.15, if the Non-Extending Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Assignment and Assumption by the later of (A)the date on which the replacement Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption and (B)the date as of which all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Non-Extending Lender relating to the Existing Term Loans so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender to such Non-Extending Lender, then such Non-Extending Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption as of such date and the Borrower shall be entitled (but not obligated)to execute and deliver such Assignment and Assumption on behalf of such Non-Extending Lender.  
(f) Following any Extension Date, with the written consent of the Borrower, any Non-Extending Lender may elect to have all or a portion of its Existing Term Loans deemed to be an Extended Term Loan under the applicable Extended Term Tranche on any date (each date a “Designation Date”)prior to the maturity date of such Extended Term Tranche; provided that such Lender shall have provided written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at least ten Business Days prior to such Designation Date (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion); provided, further, that no greater amount shall be paid by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates to any such Non-Extending Lender as consideration for its extension into such Extended Term Tranche than was paid to any Extended Lender as consideration for its Extension into such Extended Term Tranche. Following a Designation Date, the Existing Term Loans held by such Lender so elected to be extended will be deemed to be Extended Term Loans of the applicable Extended Term Tranche, and any Existing Term Loans held by such Lender not elected to be extended, if any, shall continue to be “Existing Term Loans” of the applicable Tranche.  
(g) With respect to all Extensions consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section2.15, (i)such Extensions shall not constitute optional or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of Sections2.05(a)and (b)and (ii)no Extension Request is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment, provided that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a “Minimum Extension Condition”)to consummating any such Extension that a minimum amount (to be  
116  
 determined and specified in the relevant Extension Request in the Borrower’s sole discretion and may be waived by the Borrower)of Existing Term Loans of any or all applicable Tranches be extended. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the transactions contemplated by this Section2.15 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect of any Extended Term Loans on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Request)and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections2.05(a), Section2.05(b)and 2.07)or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section2.15.  
Section2.16. Permitted Debt Exchanges.  
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, a “Permitted Debt Exchange Offer”)made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders (each of which shall be entitled to agree or decline to participate in such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer in its sole discretion) on a pro rata basis (other than any Lender that, if requested by the Borrower, is unable to certify that it is either a “qualified institutional buyer” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act)or an institutional “accredited investor” (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act))with outstanding Term Loans of a particular Tranche, as selected by the Borrower, the Borrower may from time to time following the Closing Date consummate one or more exchanges of Term Loans of such Tranche in the form of senior secured or senior unsecured, senior subordinated or subordinated notes (which notes, if secured, may either have the same Lien priority as the Obligations or may be secured by a Lien ranking junior to the Lien securing the Obligations)(such notes, “Permitted Debt Exchange Notes,” and each such exchange a “Permitted Debt Exchange”), so long as the following conditions are satisfied: (i)the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof)of Term Loans exchanged shall be equal to or less than the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof)of Permitted Debt Exchange Notes issued in exchange for such Term Loans plus accrued interest, fees and premiums (if any) thereon and reasonable fees and expenses associated with the exchange, (ii)the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof)of all Term Loans exchanged by the Borrower pursuant to any Permitted Debt Exchange shall automatically be cancelled and retired by the Borrower on the date of the settlement thereof (and, if requested by the Administrative Agent, any applicable exchanging Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, or such other form as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, in respect thereof pursuant to which the respective Lender assigns its interest in the Term Loans being exchanged pursuant to the Permitted Debt Exchange to the Borrower for immediate cancellation), (iii)such Permitted Debt Exchange Notes shall have a final maturity no earlier than the Maturity Date applicable to the Tranche of Term Loans being exchanged, (iv)the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Permitted Debt Exchange Notes shall  
117  
 not be shorter than that of the Tranche of Term Loans being exchanged, (v)such Permitted Debt Exchange Notes shall be unsecured or secured only by the Collateral and subject to the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement or an Other Intercreditor Agreement, including a Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, (vi)such Permitted Debt Exchange Notes shall not be guaranteed by any Person that is not a Guarantor, (vii)if the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans (calculated on the face amount thereof)tendered by Lenders in respect of the relevant Permitted Debt Exchange Offer (with no Lender being permitted to tender a principal amount of Term Loans which exceeds the principal amount of the applicable Tranche actually held by it)shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Term Loans offered to be exchanged by the Borrower pursuant to such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer, then the Borrower shall exchange Term Loans subject to such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer tendered by such Lenders ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts so tendered, (viii)all documentation in respect of such Permitted Debt Exchange shall be consistent with the foregoing, and all written communications generally directed to the Lenders in connection therewith shall be in form and substance consistent with the foregoing and made in consultation with the Administrative Agent, and (ix)any applicable Minimum Exchange Tender Condition shall be satisfied.  
(b) With respect to all Permitted Debt Exchanges effected by the Borrower pursuant to this Section2.16, (i)such Permitted Debt Exchanges (and the cancellation of the exchanged Term Loans in connection therewith)shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of Section2.05 and (ii)such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer shall be made for not less than $5,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Term Loans, provided that, subject to the foregoing clause (ii), the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a “Minimum Exchange Tender Condition”)to consummating any such Permitted Debt Exchange that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Permitted Debt Exchange Offer in the Borrower’s discretion)of Term Loans be tendered.  
(c) In connection with each Permitted Debt Exchange, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least ten Business Days’ (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent)prior written notice thereof, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, acting reasonably, shall mutually agree to such procedures as may be necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Section2.16; provided that the terms of any Permitted Debt Exchange Offer shall provide that the date by which the relevant Lenders are required to indicate their election to participate in such Permitted Debt Exchange shall be not less than five (5)Business Days following the date on which the Permitted Debt Exchange Offer is made.  
Section2.17. New Incremental Indebtedness.  
(a) The Borrower may from time to time, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, specifying in reasonable detail the proposed terms thereof, request to issue or  
118  
 incur one or more series of senior secured or senior unsecured, senior subordinated or subordinated notes or term loans (which, if secured, may either have the same Lien priority as the Obligations or may be secured by a Lien ranking junior to the Lien securing the Obligations) (such notes or term loans, collectively, “New Incremental Indebtedness”)in an amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount (at the time of issuance or incurrence of such New Incremental Indebtedness); provided that any such issuance or incurrence of New Incremental Indebtedness shall be in a minimum amount of the lesser of (x)$5,000,000 and (y)the entire amount that may be requested under this Section2.17.  
(b) As a condition precedent to the issuance any New Incremental Indebtedness pursuant to this Section2.17, (i)the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate dated as of the date of issuance of the New Incremental Indebtedness (the “New Incremental Indebtedness Effective Date”)signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower (to the extent the Borrower is an issuer of New Incremental Indebtedness)approving or consenting to the issuance of such New Incremental Indebtedness, and certifying that the conditions precedent set forth in the following clauses (ii)through (v)have been satisfied, (ii)such New Incremental Indebtedness shall not be Guaranteed by any Person that is not a Guarantor, (iii)such New Incremental Indebtedness will be unsecured or secured only by the Collateral and subject to the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement or an Other Intercreditor Agreement, including a Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement as applicable (iv)such New Incremental Indebtedness shall have a final maturity no earlier than the Latest Term Loan Maturity Date (other than an earlier maturity date for customary bridge financings, which, subject to customary conditions, would either be automatically converted into or required to be exchanged for permanent financing which does not provide for an earlier maturity date earlier than the Latest Term Loan Maturity Date), (v)the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such New Incremental Indebtedness shall not be shorter than that of any Tranche of Term Loans (other than a shorter Weighted Average Life to Maturity for customary bridge financings, which, subject to customary conditions, would either be automatically converted into or required to be exchanged for permanent financing which does not provide for a shorter Weighted Average Life to Maturity than the maturity date of any Tranche of Term Loans), and (vi)such New Incremental Indebtedness shall not be subject to any mandatory redemption or prepayment from asset sales, casualty or condemnation events or excess cash flow on more than a ratable basis with the Term Loans other than, with respect to such Indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Term Loans, terms of such Indebtedness which may provide for mandatory repayments or redemptions from excess cash flow in a higher percentage than the ECF Percentage.  
Section2.18. [Reserved].  
119  
Section2.19. [Reserved].  
Section2.20. Specified Refinancing Debt.  
(a) The Borrower may, from time to time, and subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), add one or more new term loan facilities to the Facilities (“Specified Refinancing Debt”)pursuant to procedures reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower, to refinance all or any portion of any Tranche of Term Loans then outstanding under this Agreement pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment; provided that such Specified Refinancing Debt: (i)will rank pari passu in right of payment as the other Loans and Commitments hereunder; (ii)will not be Guaranteed by any Person that is not a Guarantor; (iii)will be unsecured or secured only by the Collateral on pari passu or junior basis with the Obligations and shall be subject to the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement or an Other Intercreditor Agreement, including a Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement as applicable (iv)will have such pricing and optional prepayment terms as may be agreed by the Borrower and the applicable Lenders thereof; (v)will have a maturity date that is not prior to the scheduled Maturity Date of, and will have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity that is not shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of, the Tranche of Term Loans being refinanced; (vi)subject to clauses (iv)and (v)above, will have terms and conditions (other than pricing and optional and mandatory prepayment provisions) that are substantially identical to, or less favorable, taken as a whole to the Lenders providing such Specified Refinancing Debt than, the terms and conditions of the Facilities and Loans being Refinanced (as reasonably determined by the Borrower in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive); and (vi)the Net Cash Proceeds of such Specified Refinancing Debt shall be applied, substantially concurrently with the incurrence thereof, to the pro rata prepayment of outstanding Loans being so refinanced, in each case pursuant to Sections2.05 and 2.06, as applicable; provided however, that such Specified Refinancing Debt (x)may provide for any additional or different financial or other covenants or other provisions that are agreed among the Borrower Representative and the Lenders thereof and applicable only during periods after the latest maturity date of any of the Loans (and Commitments)that remain outstanding after giving effect to such Specified Refinancing Debt or the date on which all non-refinanced Obligations are paid in full and (y)shall not have a principal or commitment amount (or accreted value)greater than the Loans being refinanced (excluding accrued interest, fees, discounts, premiums and expenses).  
(b) The Borrower shall make any request for Specified Refinancing Debt pursuant to a written notice to the Administrative Agent specifying in reasonable detail the proposed terms thereof. Any proposed Specified Refinancing Debt shall first be requested on a ratable basis from existing Lenders in respect of the Facility and Loans being refinanced. At the time of sending such notice to such Lenders, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent)shall specify the time period within which  
120  
 each applicable Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days (or such shorter period as consented to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) from the date of delivery of such notice). Each applicable Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to participate in providing such Specified Refinancing Debt and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its ratable portion (based on such Lender’s ratable share in respect of the applicable Facility)of such Specified Refinancing Debt. Any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of any Specified Refinancing Debt may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Specified Refinancing Debt. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to participate in providing such Specified Refinancing Debt. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each applicable Lender of the Lenders’ responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested issuance of Specified Refinancing Debt, and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders in respect of such Specified Refinancing Debt pursuant to a joinder agreement to this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  
(c) The effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative Agent of reaffirmation agreements, including any supplements or amendments to the Guaranty and the Collateral Documents providing for such Specified Refinancing Debt to be secured thereby, consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date under Section4.01. The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be necessary in order to establish new Tranches of Specified Refinancing Debt and to make such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new Tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this Section2.20.  
(d) Each class of Specified Refinancing Debt incurred under this Section2.20 shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (x)not less than $5,000,000 and (y)an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  
(e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Refinancing Amendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent)necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Specified Refinancing Debt incurred pursuant thereto (including the addition of such Specified Refinancing Debt as separate “Facilities” and “Tranches” hereunder and treated in a manner consistent with the Facilities being refinanced,  
121  
 including for purposes of prepayments and voting). Any Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of any Person other than the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders providing such Specified Refinancing Debt, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section2.20.  
ARTICLE III  
TAXES, INCREASED COSTS PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY  
Section3.01. Taxes.  
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then amount so payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section 3.01), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.  
(b) The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.  
(c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.01, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  
(d) The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes  
122  
 were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  
(e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten days after demand therefor, for (i)any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii)any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section10.07(m) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii)any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).  
(f) (i) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, the Administrative Agent or any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section3.01(f)(ii)(A), 3.01(f)(ii)(B), 3.01(f)(ii)(C) and 3.01(f)(ii)(E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  
123  
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  
(A) The Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower on or prior to the date on which it becomes Administrative Agent under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that the Administrative Agent is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  
(B) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;  
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x)with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y)with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;  
(2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;  
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section881(c) of the Code, (x)a certificate substantially in the form of ExhibitO-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section881(c)(3)(B) of the  
124  
 Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y)executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or  
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of ExhibitO-2 or ExhibitO-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of ExhibitO-4 on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner;  
(D) and any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and  
(E) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section1471(b)(3)(C)(i)of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (E), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  
(F) The Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  
125  
(g) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.01 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  
(h) Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.  
(i) For purposes of this Section 3.01, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.  
Section3.02. Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge  
126  
 interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i)any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (ii)if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x)the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y)if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, be materially disadvantageous to such Lender in any legal, economic or regulatory aspect.  
Section3.03. Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a)Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan or (b)by reason of any changes arising on or after the Closing Date affecting the London interbank eurodollar market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x)the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (y)in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate  
127  
 component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders)revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.  
Section3.04. Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy.  
(a) If as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, in each case after the date hereof, or such Lender’s compliance therewith,  
(i) any Recipient reasonably determines that it will be subject to any Taxes (other than (A)Indemnified Taxes, (B)Taxes described in clauses (b)through (d)of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C)Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount); or  
(ii) any Lender reasonably determines that there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Loan, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any Loan,  
then within 15 days after demand of such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduction.  
(b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office)therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender’s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity and such Lender’s desired return on capital), then within 15 days after demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such  
128  
 reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.  
(c) [Reserved].  
(d) If any Lender requests compensation under this Section3.04, then such Lender will, if requested by the Borrower and at the Borrower’s expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event; provided that such efforts would not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, be inconsistent with the internal policies of, or otherwise be materially disadvantageous in any legal, economic or regulatory respect to such Lender or its Lending Office. The provisions of this clause (d)shall not affect or postpone any Obligations of the Borrower or rights of such Lender pursuant to Sections3.04(a) or (b).  
(e) For purposes of this Section3.04, (i)the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii)all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority)or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall, in each case, be deemed to have gone into effect after the date hereof, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.  
Section3.05. Funding Losses. Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)from time to time, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating such compensation, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by it as a result of:  
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a Base Rate Loan)on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan)to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan (other than a Base Rate Loan)on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or  
(c) any mandatory assignment of such Lender’s Loans (other than Base Rate Loans)pursuant to Section3.07 on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loans;  
129  
 including any loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits)arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained, but excluding any such loss for which no reasonable means of calculation exist, as set forth in Section3.03.  
Section3.06. Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation.  
(a) Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this ArticleIII shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower contemporaneously with the demand for payment, setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  
(b) With respect to any Lender’s claim for compensation under Section3.02, 3.03 or 3.04, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender for (i)any amount incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event that gives rise to such claim; provided that, if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof or (ii)solely in the case of Section3.02 or 3.04, any amounts, if such Lender is applying such provision to the Borrower in a manner that is inconsistent with its application of “increased cost” or other similar provisions under other syndicated loan agreements to similarly situated borrowers. If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under Section3.04, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue from one Interest Period to another Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section3.06(c)shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.  
(c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or continue from one Interest Period to another any Eurodollar Rate Loan, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section3.06(b)hereof, such Lender’s Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s)of the then current Interest Period(s)for such Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of an immediate conversion required by Section3.02, on such earlier date as required by Law)and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section3.02, 3.03 or 3.04 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist:  
(i) to the extent that such Lender’s Eurodollar Rate Loans have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender’s Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and  
(ii) all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued from one Interest Period to another by such Lender as Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made or continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be converted into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.  
130  
(d) If any Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)that the circumstances specified in Section3.02, 3.03 or 3.04 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such Lender’s Eurodollar Rate Loans pursuant to this Section3.06 no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist)at a time when Eurodollar Rate Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lender’s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s)of the next succeeding Interest Period(s)for such outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Rate Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest Periods)in accordance with their respective Commitments.  
Section3.07. Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances.  
(a) Mitigation; Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section3.04(a) or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section3.01, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or assigning its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i)would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections3.01 or 3.04(a), as the case may be, in the future, and (ii)would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  
(b) Subject to Section3.07(a), if at any time (i)the Borrower becomes obligated to pay additional amounts or indemnity payments described in Section3.01 or 3.04 or any Lender ceases to make Eurodollar Rate Loans as a result of any condition described in Section3.02 or 3.03, (ii)any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iii)any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender (as defined below in this Section3.07) (collectively, a “Replaceable Lender”), then the Borrower may, on one Business Day’s prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and such Lender, either (i)replace such  
131  
 Lender by causing such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to Section10.07(b) (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower unless waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance) 100% of its relevant Commitments and the principal of its relevant outstanding Loans plus any accrued and unpaid interest together with all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement Lender or other such Person or (ii)so long as no Default known to the Borrower or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, terminate the applicable Commitment of such Lender and repay all applicable obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender relating to the Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date.  
(c) Any Lender being replaced pursuant to Section3.07(a)above shall (i)execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender’s Commitment and outstanding Loans and (ii)deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or Administrative Agent. Pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, (A)the assignee Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and outstanding Loans, (B)all Obligations relating to the Loans so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender (or, at its option, by the Borrower) to such assigning Lender concurrently with such assignment and assumption and (C)upon such payment and, if so requested by the assignee Lender, the assigning Lender shall deliver to the assignee Lender the applicable Note or Notes executed by the Borrower, the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender. In connection with any such replacement, if any such Replaceable Lender (as defined above)does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such replacement within one Business Day of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption to such Replaceable Lender, then such Replaceable Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of the Replaceable Lender. In connection with the replacement of any Lender pursuant to Section3.07(a)above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts as may be required pursuant to Section3.05.  
(d) The Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section9.09.  
(e) In the event that (i)the Borrower or the Administrative Agent have requested the Lenders to consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the Loan Documents or to agree to any amendment or other modification thereto, (ii)the consent, waiver, amendment or modification in question requires the agreement of all Lenders or  
132  
 all affected Lenders in accordance with the terms of Section10.01 or all the Lenders with respect to a certain class of the Loans and (iii)the Required Lenders have agreed to such waiver, amendment or modification, then any Lender who does not agree to such waiver, amendment or modification shall be deemed a “Non-Consenting Lender.”  
Section3.08. Survival. All of the Loan Parties’ obligations under this ArticleIII shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  
ARTICLE IV  
CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS

(d) All actions necessary to establish that the Collateral Agent will have a perfected security interest (to the extent contemplated in the Collateral Documents and with the priority contemplated therein and in the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement and subject to no Liens other than the Liens permitted under Section7.01)in the Collateral shall have been taken, in each case, to the extent such Collateral (including the creation or perfection of any security interest)is required to be provided on the Closing Date pursuant to the last paragraph of this Section4.01.

136  
Section4.02. Conditions to All Credit Extensions. The obligation of each Lender to honor any Request for Credit Extension (other than (x)with respect to Incremental Loans being incurred in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, and (y)a Committed Loan Notice requesting only a conversion of Loans to the other Type, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (each, an “Excluded Request”)) is subject to the following conditions precedent:  
(a) The representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in ArticleV or any other Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such Credit Extension, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section4.02, the representations and warranties contained in Sections5.05(a)shall be deemed to refer to the most recent financial statements furnished pursuant to Section6.01(a) and (b), respectively, prior to such proposed Credit Extension.  
(b) No Default shall exist, or would result from such proposed Credit Extension or from the application of the proceeds therefrom.

ARTICLE V  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  
The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (after giving effect to the Transactions)that:  
Section5.01. Existence, Qualification and Power; Compliance with Laws. The Borrower and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries (a)is a Person duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable in the relevant jurisdiction)under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, (b)has all requisite power and authority to (i)own or lease its assets and carry on its business and (ii)execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Loan

ARTICLE IX  
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER AGENTS  
Section9.01. Appointment and Authorization of Agents.  
(a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall any Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against any Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  
(b) [Reserved].  
(c) The Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Cash Management Bank party to a Secured Cash Management Agreement, a potential Hedge Bank party to a Secured Hedge Agreement)hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” (and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section9.02 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof)granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this ArticleIX (including Section9.07, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents)as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.  
195  
Section9.02. Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof)granted under the Collateral Documents or of exercising any rights and remedies thereunder)by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.  
Section9.03. Liability of Agents. No Agent-Related Person shall (a)be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein, to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction)or (b)be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest created or purported to be created under the Collateral Documents, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.  
Section9.04. Reliance by Agents.  
(a) Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or such greater  
196  
 number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance)as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance)and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.  
(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Sections4.01 and 4.02, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date, specifying its objection thereto.  
Section9.05. Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to any Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with ArticleVIII; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.  
Section9.06. Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Agents. Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions  
197  
 contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower and the other Loan Parties hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.  
Section9.07. Indemnification of Agents. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Lender shall, on a ratable basis based on such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of all the Facilities, indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party to do so), and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person in each case from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by such Agent-Related Person; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any Indemnified Liabilities incurred by an Agent-Related Person to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section9.07. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section9.07 shall apply whether or not any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its pro rata share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel)incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section9.07 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.  
198  
Section9.08. Agents in Their Individual Capacities. Any Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire Equity Interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though it were not an Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, an Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate)and acknowledge that such Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, such Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not an Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” include such Agent in its individual capacity.  
Section9.09. Successor Agents. The Administrative Agent may resign as the Administrative Agent upon 30 days’ notice to the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be subject to the consent of the Borrower (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if such successor is a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or any political subdivision thereof which has combined capital and reserves in excess of $5,000,000,000)at all times other than if an Event of Default under Section8.01(a), (f), or (g)is continuing. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term “Administrative Agent” shall mean such successor administrative agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent’s appointment, powers and duties as the Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of this ArticleIX and Sections10.04 and 10.05 shall continue in effect for its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor agent has been appointed and accepted such appointment as the Administrative Agent by the date which is 45 days following the retiring Administrative Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to continue the  
199  
 perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents, the Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor or upon the expiration of the 45-day period following the retiring Administrative Agent’s notice of resignation without a successor agent having been appointed, the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. If the Administrative Agent becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent may be removed as the Administrative Agent hereunder by the Borrower or the Required Lenders.  
Section9.10. Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower)shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04)allowed in such judicial proceeding; and  
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;  
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections2.09 and 10.04.  
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.  
200

In each case as specified in this Section9.11, the Administrative Agent will, at the Borrower’s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to subordinate any Lien thereon granted to or held by the Administrative Agent, or to release such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section9.11; provided that the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying that any such transaction has been consummated in compliance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  
Section9.12. Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements. No Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of Section8.04, the Guaranty, the Security Agreement, the Pledge Agreement or any other Collateral Document by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Guaranty, the Security Agreement, the Pledge Agreement or any other Collateral Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral)other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.

Section9.14. Additional Indebtedness. In connection with the incurrence by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness to be secured by a Lien on any Collateral permitted by Section7.01 of this Agreement, at the request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (including in its capacity as “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents) agrees to enter into the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Priority Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Other Intercreditor Agreement, and execute and deliver any amendments, amendments and restatements, restatements or waivers of or supplements to or other modifications to such agreements (each, an “Intercreditor Agreement Supplement”), and any amendments, amendments and restatements, restatements or waivers of or supplements to or other modifications to, the Guaranty or any Collateral Document, and to make or consent to any filings or take any other actions in connection therewith, as may be reasonably determined by the Borrower, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to be necessary or reasonably desirable for any Lien on the Collateral permitted to secure such additional Indebtedness to become a valid, perfected lien (with such priority as may be designated by the Borrower, to the extent such priority is permitted by the Loan Documents) pursuant to the Collateral Document being so amended, amended and restated, restated, waived, supplemented or otherwise modified. The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to take any action contemplated by the preceding sentence, and any such amendment, amendment and restatement, restatement, waiver of or supplement to or other modification of any such Loan Document shall be effective notwithstanding the provisions of Section10.01.  
Section9.15. Withholding Taxes. To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Sections 3.01 and 10.04, each Lender shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefore, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other  
203  
 Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this paragraph. The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations under any Loan Document.

MISCELLANEOUS  
Section10.01. Amendments, Etc. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, no amendment, waiver or consent of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:  
(a) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender, or reinstate the Commitment of any Lender after the termination of such Commitment pursuant to Section8.02, in each case without the written consent of such Lender, it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section4.02 or the waiver of any Default or Event of Default, mandatory prepayment, mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment of any Lender (provided that, any Lender upon the request of the Borrower, may increase its Commitment or extend the maturity or termination date thereof without the consent of any other Lender, including the Required Lenders);  
(b) postpone any date scheduled for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Loan, or any fees or premium payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (and subject to such further requirements as may be applicable thereto under the last two paragraphs of this Section), it being understood that the waiver of any obligation to pay interest at the Default Rate, and the amendment or waiver of any mandatory prepayment of Loans, shall not constitute a postponement of any date scheduled for the payment of principal, interest or fees (provided that any Lender, upon the request of the Borrower, may extend the maturity date of any Loans owing to it without the consent of any other Lender, including the Required Lenders);  
(c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Loan or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely  
204  
 affected thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend the definition of “Default Rate” or to waive any obligation to pay interest at the Default Rate;  
(d) modify Section2.06(c) or 2.13 without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby;  
(e) change any provision of this Section10.01 (other than the last two paragraphs of this Section10.01) or the definition of “Required Lenders,” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or to make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender;  
(f) other than in a transaction permitted under Section7.04 or 7.05, release all or substantially all of the Collateral in any transaction or series of related transactions, without the written consent of each Lender; or  
(g) other than in a transaction permitted under Section7.04 or 7.05, release all or substantially all of the value of the aggregate guarantees of the Obligations under the Guaranty, without the written consent of each Lender;  
and provided further that (i)[reserved]; (ii)[reserved]; (iii)no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such, in addition to the Borrower and the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of, or any fees or other amounts payable to, the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iv)Section10.07(g) may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified without the consent of each Granting Lender all or any part of whose Loans are being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment, waiver or other modification; and (v)the JPM Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A)any waiver, amendment, modification or consent in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document of Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of a particular Tranche (but not the Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of any other Tranche) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the requisite percentage in interest of the Lenders with respect to such Tranche that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if such Lenders were the only Lenders hereunder at the time, and (B)in determining whether the requisite percentage of Lenders have consented to any amendment, modification, waiver or other action, any Defaulting Lenders or Affiliate Lenders (other than Debt Fund Affiliates) shall be deemed to have voted in the same proportion as those Lenders who are not Defaulting Lenders or Affiliate Lenders, except with respect to (x)any amendment, modification or other action or plan of reorganization  
205  
 which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender (including without limitation those set forth in Section10.01(a), (b)and (c)) and (y)any amendment, modification, waiver or other action that by its terms adversely affects any Defaulting Lender or Affiliate Lender in its capacity as a Lender in a manner that differs in any material respect from, and is more adverse to such Defaulting Lender or Affiliate Lender than it is to, other affected Lenders, in which case the consent of such Defaulting Lender or Affiliate Lender, as applicable, shall be required.  
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary, each Affiliate Lender (other than a Debt Fund Affiliate) hereby agrees that, if a proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any other Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law shall be commenced by or against the Borrower or any other Loan Party at a time when such Lender is an Affiliate Lender, such Affiliate Lender irrevocably authorizes and empowers the Administrative Agent to vote on behalf of such Affiliate Lender with respect to the Loans held by such Affiliate Lender in any manner in the Administrative Agent’s sole discretion, unless the Administrative Agent instructs such Affiliate Lender to vote, in which case such Affiliate Lender shall vote with respect to the Loans held by it as the Administrative Agent directs; provided that such Affiliate Lender shall be entitled to vote in accordance with its sole discretion (and not in accordance with the direction of the Administrative Agent) in connection with any plan of reorganization to the extent any such plan of reorganization proposes to treat any such Affiliate Lender or the Obligations held by it in a manner that is less favorable in any material respect to such Affiliate Lender than the proposed treatment of similar Lenders and the Obligations held by them that are not Affiliates of the Borrower.  
This Section10.01 shall be subject to any contrary provision of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.20 or 6.17. In addition, notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this Section10.01, (a)if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly identified any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision and (b)the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend any provision of the Guaranty or any Collateral Document to better implement the intentions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any such amendment agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with any amendment, modification, waiver or other action requiring the consent or approval of Required Lenders, Lenders that are Debt Fund Affiliates shall not be permitted, in the aggregate, to account for more than 49.9% of the amounts actually included in determining whether the “Required Lenders” have consented to any amendment,  
206  
 modification, waiver, consent or other action that is subject to such vote. The voting power of each Lender that is a Debt Fund Affiliate shall be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary in order to comply with the immediately preceding sentence.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time and from time to time, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the applicable Lenders) specifying in reasonable detail the proposed terms thereof, the Borrower may make one or more loan modification offers to all the Lenders of any Facility that would, if and to the extent accepted by any such Lender, (a)change the Applicable Rate and/or fees payable with respect to the Loans and Commitments under such Facility (in each case solely with respect to the Loans and Commitments of accepting Lenders in respect of which an acceptance is delivered) and (b)treat the Loans and Commitments so modified as a new “Facility” and a new “Tranche” for all purposes under this Agreement; provided that (i)such loan modification offer is made to each Lender under the applicable Facility on the same terms and subject to the same procedures as are applicable to all other Lenders under such Facility (which procedures in any case shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) and (ii)no loan modification shall affect the rights or duties of, or any fees or other amounts payable to, the Administrative Agent, without its prior written consent.  
In connection with any such loan modification, the Borrower and each accepting Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such agreements and other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the acceptance of the applicable loan modification offer and the terms and conditions thereof, and this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be amended in a writing (which may be executed and delivered by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and shall be effective only with respect to the applicable Loans and Commitments of Lenders that shall have accepted the relevant loan modification offer (and only with respect to Loans and Commitments as to which any such Lender has accepted the loan modification offer)) to the extent necessary or appropriate, in the judgment of the Administrative Agent, to reflect the existence of, and to give effect to the terms and conditions of, the applicable loan modification (including the addition of such modified Loans and/or Commitments as a “Facility” or a “Tranche” hereunder). No Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to accept any loan modification offer, and may reject any such offer in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification referred to above shall become effective unless the Administrative Agent, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, shall have received reaffirmation agreements with respect to the Borrower and all Material Guarantors.  
Section10.02. Notices; Electronic Communications.  
(a) General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail, sent by telecopier or

Notices and other communications sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices and other communications sent by telecopier or electronic mail shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient). Notices and other communications delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in subsection (b)below shall be effective as provided in such subsection (b).  
(b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including Internet or intranet websites, but excluding electronic mail which is subject to clause (a)of this Section10.02) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving, or is unwilling to receive, notices under such Article II by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.  
Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes (with the Borrower’s consent), notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i)of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.  
(c) The Platform. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” THE AGENT-RELATED PERSONS DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR  
208  
 ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall any Agent-Related Person have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower’s or the Administrative Agent’s transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent-Related Person; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent-Related Person have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).  
(d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may change its address, telecopier, telephone number or electronic mail address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, telecopier, telephone number or electronic mail address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i)an effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number and electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii)accurate wire instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the “Private Side Information” or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender’s compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.  
(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Committed Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i)such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii)the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The  
209  
 Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower to the extent required by Section10.05. All telephonic notes to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.  
Section10.03. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided hereunder and under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a)the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b)[reserved], (c)any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section10.09 (subject to the terms of Section2.13), or (d)any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law.  
Section10.04. Expenses and Taxes. The Borrower agrees (a)to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and the other Agents for all reasonable and documented or invoiced out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, syndication, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including reasonable expenses incurred in connection with due diligence and travel, courier, reproduction, printing and delivery expenses), and any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are consummated), and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel (limited to the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of Davis Polk& Wardwell LLP and, if necessary, any specialist counsel or one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction (and,  
210  
 in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, where the party affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, of another firm of counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for each such affected person)), and (b)to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the other Agents and each Lender for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any legal proceeding, including, without duplication of Taxes or Other Taxes paid or indemnified pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04, any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or in connection with any workout or restructuring and all documentary taxes associated with the Facilities), including the fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel (limited to the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to the Administrative Agent, the other Agents and the Lenders taken as a whole, and, if necessary, of any specialist counsel or one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction (and, in the event of any actual or perceived conflict of interest where the Agent or Lender affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for each Lender or group of Lenders or Agents subject to such conflict), in each case without duplication for any amounts paid (or indemnified) under Section3.01. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include, without duplication of Taxes or Other Taxes paid or indemnified pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04, all reasonable search, filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Agent. All amounts due under this Section10.04 shall be paid within 30 days after invoiced or demand therefor (with a reasonably detailed invoice with respect thereto) (except for any such costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date, which shall be paid on the Closing Date to the extent invoiced at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date). The agreements in this Section10.04 shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations. If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs, expenses or other amounts payable by it hereunder or under any Loan Document, such amount may be paid on behalf of such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in its sole discretion.  
Section10.05. Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each Arranger, each Agent-Related Person, each Lender, each of their respective Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors, agents, controlling persons and other representatives (collectively, the “Indemnitees”) from and against (and will reimburse each Indemnitee, as and when incurred, for) any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs (including settlement costs), disbursements, and reasonable and documented or invoiced out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of (i)one counsel to the Indemnitees taken as a whole, (ii)in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, where the Indemnitee affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its  
211  
 own counsel, of another firm of counsel for each such affected Indemnitee in each relevant jurisdiction, and (iii)if necessary, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction (which may include a special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted or awarded against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (x)any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding in any way relating to, arising out of, in connection with or by reason of any of the following, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding): (a)the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (b)the Transactions, the Separation and Distribution or any of the other transactions contemplated thereby or (c)any Commitment, Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee (or any of its Affiliates, or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors, agents, controlling persons or other representatives), be available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, disbursements, fees or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (A)the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors, agents, controlling persons or other representatives (in each case, with respect to such person only, and not any other person), (B)from a material breach of the Loan Documents by such Indemnitee or one of its Affiliates or (C)with respect to any claim that did not arise out of any act or omission of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or any direct or indirect parent or controlling person thereof, any dispute that is among Indemnitees (other than any dispute involving claims against any Agent or Arranger, in its capacity as such); or (y)any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by the Loan Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any violation or noncompliance with any Environmental Law or Environmental Liability related in any way to the Loan Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or their respective current or former operations or properties, ((x)and (y), collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”) in all cases, whether or not caused by or arising, in whole or in part, out of the negligence of the Indemnitee and regardless of whether such Indemnitee is a party thereto, and whether or not such proceedings are brought by the Borrower, its equity holders, its Affiliates, creditors or any other third person. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials obtained through the Platform or other information transmission systems (including electronic telecommunications) in connection with this Agreement unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any such Indemnitee’s affiliates or any of its or their respective  
212  
 officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, controlling persons or other representatives, nor shall any Indemnitee or any Loan Party have any liability for any special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date); provided that such waiver of special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages shall not limit the indemnification obligations of the Loan Parties to the extent such special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages are included in any third party claim with respect to which the applicable Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Section10.05. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section10.05 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnitee or any other Person, and whether or not any Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto. Should any investigation, litigation or proceeding be settled, or if there is a judgment against an Indemnitee in any such investigation, litigation or proceeding, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee in the manner set forth above. The Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without the written consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if settled with such consent, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Indemnitee from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. All amounts due under this Section10.05 shall be payable within 30 days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section10.05 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. This Section10.05 shall not apply with respect to Indemnified Taxes other than any Indemnified Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-tax claim.  
Section10.06. Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to any Agent or any Lender, or any Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a)to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b)each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by any Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under clause (b)of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  
213  
Section10.07. Successors and Assigns.  
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender (other than in accordance with Section7.04) and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i)to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section10.07(b), (ii)by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section10.07(d), (iii)by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section10.07(f) or (iv)to an SPC in accordance with the provisions of Section10.07(g) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section10.07(d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  
(b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s) and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that:  
(i) (A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment under any Facility and the Loans at the time owing to it under such Facility or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, no minimum amount shall need be assigned, and (B)in any case not described in clause (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default under Section8.01(a), (f)or (g)has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met;

(ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii)shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis;  
(iii) (A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; it being understood that, without limitation, the Borrower shall have the right to withhold its consent to any assignment if, in order for such assignment to comply with Law, the Borrower would be required to obtain the consent of, or make any filing or registration with, any Governmental Authority) shall be required for any assignment unless (1)an Event of Default under Section8.01(a), (f)or (g)has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2)such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it objects thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof; and (B)the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment unless such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (provided that the Administrative Agent shall acknowledge such assignment);  
(iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or, if previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually), together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (except, (x)in the case of contemporaneous assignments by any Lender to one or more Approved Funds, only a single processing and recording fee shall be payable for such assignments, (y)in the case of assignments by JPMCB or any of its Affiliates in connection with the primary syndication of the Facilities and (z)the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may elect to waive such processing and recording fee in the case of any assignment);  
(v) no such assignment shall be made (A)to any natural person or (B)(i)to any competitors of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries that have been specified to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in writing from time to time, and any of their Affiliates, (other than Bona Fide Debt Funds), that are clearly identifiable on the basis of such Affiliates’ names or identified in writing by the Borrower from time to time (any such Person, a “Disqualified Lender”), with the list of such Disqualified Lenders as of the Closing Date set forth on Schedule 10.07(b)(v) (it being understood that (i)the Borrower shall not be required to specify Affiliates that are clearly identifiable on the basis of such Affiliates’ names on such schedule, (ii)the Borrower may update such schedule  
215  
 from time to time with respect to Disqualified Lenders meeting the criteria specified above, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly post such updated schedule to the Platform promptly following its receipt thereof, with such updates effective solely upon the posting thereof to the Platform and (iii)in no event shall the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such) (x)be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender is a Disqualified Lender or (y)have any liability with respect to any assignment or participation of Loans or Commitments to any Disqualified Lender); and  
(vi) [reserved];  
(vii) the assigning Lender shall deliver any Notes or, in lieu thereof, a lost note affidavit and indemnity reasonably acceptable to the Borrower evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section10.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits (and to have the obligations) of a Lender under Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 10.04 and 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment, and to be subject to the obligations set forth in Section10.08. Upon request, and the surrender by the assigning Lender of its Note, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this clause (b), Section2.15(e) or Section3.07(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section10.07(d).  
(c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”); provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such accounts or records shall not limit the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall record in the Register each assignment  
216  
 made pursuant to the terms hereof. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Agent and any Lender (with respect to itself), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  
(d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or any Disqualified Lender) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i)such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii)the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section10.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to Section10.07(e), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and the limitations of such Sections) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section10.07(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section2.13 as though it were a Lender.  
(e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent.  
(f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment, and no foreclosure or other enforcement action in respect thereof, shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  
217  
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an “SPC”) the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i)nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii)if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof or, if it fails to do so, to make such payment to the Administrative Agent as is required under Section2.12(b)(ii). Each party hereto hereby agrees that an SPC shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and the limitations of such Sections) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had assigned its interest by assignment pursuant to Section10.07(b); provided that neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including under Section3.01, 3.04 or 3.05). Each party hereto further agrees that (i)no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (ii)the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the Lender of record hereunder. Other than as expressly provided in this Section10.07(g), (A)such Granting Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B)such Granting Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C)the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Granting Lender in connection with such Granting Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not, other than in respect of matters unrelated to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i)with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of its rights hereunder with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii)subject to Section10.08, disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.  
218  
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities; provided that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section10.07, (i)no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents, and (ii)such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.  
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender may assign all or any portion of its Term Loans to any Affiliate Lender (including any Debt Fund Affiliate), but only if:  
(i) the assigning Lender and such Affiliate Lender purchasing such Lender’s Term Loans shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 hereto (an “Affiliate Lender Assignment and Assumption”) in lieu of an Assignment and Assumption;  
(ii) after giving effect to such assignment, Affiliate Lenders (other than Debt Fund Affiliates) shall not, in the aggregate, own or hold Term Loans with an aggregate principal amount in excess of 25% of the principal amount of all Term Loans then outstanding (calculated as of the date of such purchase); and  
(iii) such Affiliate Lender (other than Debt Fund Affiliates) shall at all times thereafter be subject to the voting restrictions specified in Section10.01.  
(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Lender may assign all or any portion of its Term Loans to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, but only if:  
(i) (x) such assignment is made pursuant to a Dutch auction or similar procedures open to all Term Lenders on a pro rata basis as described in Section2.05(a)(vi) or (y)such assignment is made pursuant to an open market purchase;  
(ii) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom; and  
(iii) any such Term Loans shall be automatically and permanently cancelled immediately upon acquisition thereof by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.  
219  
(k) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i)Affiliate Lenders (other than Debt Fund Affiliates) shall not have any right to attend (including by telephone) any meeting or discussions (or portion thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any other Lender to which representatives of the Borrower are not then present, (ii)Affiliate Lenders (other than Debt Fund Affiliates) shall not have any right to receive any information or material prepared by the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any communication by or among the Administrative Agent and one or more other Lenders, except to the extent such information or materials have been made available to the Borrower or its representatives and (iii)Affiliate Lenders (other than Debt Fund Affiliates) shall not be entitled to receive advice of counsel to the Agents or other Lenders.  
(ii) Each Lender making an assignment to an Affiliate Lender acknowledges and agrees that in connection with such assignment, (1)such Affiliate Lender then may have, and later may come into possession of, information regarding the Term Loans or the Loan Parties hereunder that is not known to such Lender and that may be material to a decision by such Lender to assign the Term Loans (“Excluded Information”), (2)such Lender has independently and, without reliance on the Affiliate Lender, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent or any of their respective Affiliates, made its own analysis and determination to enter into such assignment notwithstanding such Lender’s lack of knowledge of the Excluded Information and (3)none of the Borrower, its Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent, or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability to such Lender, and such Lender hereby waives and releases, to the extent permitted by law, any claims such Lender may have against the Borrower, its Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent, and their respective Affiliates, under applicable laws or otherwise, with respect to the nondisclosure of the Excluded Information. Each Lender entering into such an assignment further acknowledges that the Excluded Information may not be available to the Administrative Agent or the other Lenders.  
(l) [Reserved],  
(m) The applicable Lender, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (solely for tax purposes), shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of (i)each SPC (other than any SPC that is treated as a disregarded entity of the Granting Lender for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that has exercised its option pursuant to Section10.07(g) and (ii)each Participant, and the amount of each such SPC’s and Participant’s interest in such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document)  
220  
 to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary (x)in connection with a tax audit or other proceeding to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or (y)for the Borrower to enforce its rights hereunder. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of the applicable rights and/or obligations of such Lender under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  
Section10.08. Confidentiality. Each of the Agents and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information, except that Information may be disclosed (a)to its directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors and numbering administration and settlement service providers and other Affiliates, on a need to know basis (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made by such Lender or Agent will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential in accordance with the terms of this Section10.08 and such Agent or Lender will be responsible for their compliance herewith); (b)to the extent requested by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such Agent, Lender or its respective Affiliates or in connection with any pledge or assignment permitted under Section10.07(f); (c)in any legal, judicial, administrative proceeding or other compulsory process or otherwise as required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d)to any other party to this Agreement; (e)in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f)subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same (or at least as restrictive) as those of this Section10.08 (or as may otherwise be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower), to any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or prospective direct or indirect controlled counterparties under Swap Contracts to be entered into in connection with the Loans made hereunder, in each case, other than to a Disqualified Lender; (g)with the written consent of the Borrower; (h)to the extent such Information becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section10.08; (i)to the extent that such information is received by an Agent or Lender from a third party that is not, to such Agent’s or Lender’s knowledge, subject to contractual or fiduciary contractual obligations owning to any Loan Party; (j)to any state, federal or foreign authority or examiner (including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization) regulating any Lender; or (k)by the Administrative Agent to any rating agency when required by it (it being understood that, prior to any such disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the confidentiality of any Information relating to the Loan Parties received by it from the Administrative Agent). In addition, the Agents and the Lenders may disclose  
221  
 the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the Credit Extensions; provided that such Person is advised and agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section10.08. For the purposes of this Section10.08, “Information” means all information received from or on behalf of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents and relating to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof (including any information relating to their respective businesses and operations), other than any such information that is publicly available to any Agent or any Lender prior to such disclosure other than as a result of a breach of this Section10.08 by such Lender or Agent. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section10.08 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Assignment and Acceptance, the provisions of this Section10.08 shall survive with respect to the Administrative Agent, each Co-Documentation Agent, each Arranger and each Lender until the second anniversary of such Administrative Agent, Co-Documentation Agent, Arranger or Lender ceasing to be an Administrative Agent, Co-Documentation Agent, Arranger or Lender, respectively.  
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (i)the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary of either, as the case may be, (ii)it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (iii)it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.  
Section10.09. Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Secured Party is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), other than deposits in fiduciary accounts as to which a Loan Party is acting as fiduciary for another Person who is not a Loan Party, at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Secured Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not such Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under  
222  
 this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness. Each Secured Party agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Secured Party; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party under this Section10.09 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the Administrative Agent and such Secured Party may have. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, in no event shall the assets of any Foreign Subsidiary constitute security, or shall the proceeds of such assets be available for, payment of the Obligations of the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary, it being understood that (a)up to 65% of each class of Equity Interests of a Foreign Subsidiary that is directly owned by a Domestic Subsidiary does not constitute such an asset (and may be pledged to the extent set forth in Section6.12) and (b)the provisions hereof shall not limit, reduce or otherwise diminish in any respect the Borrower’s obligations to make any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section2.05(b)(ii).  
Section10.10. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”). If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b)exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof and (c)amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.  
Section10.11. Counterparts. This Agreement and each other Loan Document may be executed in one or more counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier, electronic mail or other electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement and such other Loan Document. The Agents may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier, electronic mail or other electronic transmission be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission.  
223  
Section10.12. Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the JPM Fee Letter, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. It is expressly agreed and confirmed by the parties hereto that the provisions of the JPM Fee Letter shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the occurrence of the Closing Date, and shall continue in effect thereafter in accordance with its terms. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.  
Section10.13. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by each Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation (other than contingent indemnification or other obligations, obligations and liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements) hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.  
Section10.14. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section10.14, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.  
Section10.15. [Reserved].

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section2(b), the Borrower, solely with respect to the obligations of the other Guarantors under Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements, and each of the other Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantee, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Term Loan Secured Parties, the prompt and complete payment (and not of collection) and performance when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether currently existing or hereafter incurred. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to pay any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Collateral Agent for distribution to the applicable Term Loan Secured Parties the amount of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligation.

(b) Anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall in no event exceed the amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under Laws relating to the insolvency of debtors or an amount unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such Guarantor or as the result of any avoidance actions therein.  
(c) To the extent the Borrower would be required to do so by Section10.04 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, each Guarantor further agrees to pay any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that may be paid or incurred by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party in enforcing any rights with respect to, or collecting, any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations and/or enforcing any rights with respect to, or collecting against, such Guarantor under this Guaranty.  
(d) Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor hereunder without impairing this Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party hereunder.  
(e) No payment or payments made by the Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party from the Borrower, any Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or in payment of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, which shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments other than payments made by such Guarantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or payments received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, remain liable for the Guaranteed Obligations up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Release Date.  
(f) Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower’s and each other Loan Party’s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Collateral Agent or the other Term Loan Secured Parties will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.  
5  
3. Right of Contribution. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share (based, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, on the respective Adjusted Net Worth of the Guarantors on the date the respective payment is made) of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder that has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor’s right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section5 hereof. The provisions of this Section3 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties, and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.  
4. Right of Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Term Loan Secured Parties provided by Law, subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably authorizes each Term Loan Secured Party at any time and from time to time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default without notice to such Guarantor or any other Guarantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each Guarantor, upon any amount becoming due and payable by such Guarantor hereunder (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) other than deposits held in Exempt Deposit Accounts, in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Term Loan Secured Party to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor and irrespective of whether or not such Term Loan Secured Party shall have made demand under this Guaranty or any other Loan Document. Each Term Loan Secured Party shall notify such Guarantor and the Collateral Agent promptly of any such set-off and the appropriation and application made by such Term Loan Secured Party; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and appropriation and application. This Section4 is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section10.09 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
5. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any of the Guarantors hereunder or any set-off or appropriation and application of funds of any of the Guarantors by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until the Release Date. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on  
6  
 account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the Release Date, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Collateral Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Collateral Agent, if required), to be applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether due or to become due, in accordance with Section5.04 of the Term Loan Security Agreement.  
6. Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; Waiver of Rights. Except for termination of a Guarantor’s obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section24, each Guarantor shall (to the maximum extent permitted by law) remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, (a)any demand for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations made by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party may be rescinded by such party and any of the Guaranteed Obligations continued, (b)the Guaranteed Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, (c)the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith, the Secured Hedge Agreements and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith, the Secured Cash Management Agreements and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith, may be amended, waived, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in accordance with the terms of the applicable document and (d)any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Term Loan Secured Party shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for this Guaranty or any property subject thereto. When making any demand hereunder against any Guarantor, the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any Guarantor or other guarantor, and any failure by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any Guarantor or other guarantor or any release of the Borrower or any Guarantor or other guarantor shall not relieve any Guarantor in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or any Guarantor not so released of its several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof, “demand” shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.  
7  
7. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any and all notice of the creation, contraction, incurrence, renewal, extension, amendment, waiver or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including as a result of the incurrence of Incremental Term Loans and/or the provision of any Incremental Revolving Commitment, Supplemental Term Loan Commitments or Supplemental Revolving Commitments), and notice of or proof of reliance by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party upon this Guaranty or acceptance of this Guaranty, the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended, waived or accrued, in reliance upon this Guaranty; and all dealings between the Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guaranty. Each Guarantor waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, promptness, diligence, presentment, protest, notice of protest, demand for payment and notice of default, acceleration or nonpayment and any other notice to or upon the Borrower or any Guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor understands and agrees that this Guaranty shall (to the maximum extent permitted by law) be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment (and not of collection) without regard to (a)the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Secured Hedge Agreement, any Secured Cash Management Agreement, any of the other Guaranteed Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, (b)any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) that may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower against the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, (c)any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations by the Guarantors or (d)any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrower or such Guarantor) that constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for the Guaranteed Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Collateral Agent and any other Term Loan Secured Party may elect, but shall be under no obligation, to pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve such Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Collateral  
8  
 Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties against such Guarantor. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement, subrogation, exoneration, contribution or indemnification or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor, as the case may be, or any security. Each Guarantor expressly waives all rights that it may have now or in the future under any statute, at common law, in equity or otherwise, to compel the Collateral Agent or Lenders to marshal assets. If acceleration of the time for payment of any Guaranteed Obligation by the Borrower or the applicable Guarantor is stayed by reason of the insolvency or receivership of the Borrower or the applicable Guarantor or otherwise, all Guaranteed Obligations otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any Secured Debt Document shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder. This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon each Guarantor and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties, and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, until the Release Date, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash Management Agreement the Loan Parties may be free from any Guaranteed Obligations.  
8. [Intentionally Omitted].  
9. Representations and Warranties; Covenants. Each Guarantor hereby (a)represents and warrants that the representations and warranties as to it made by the Borrower in ArticleV of the Term Loan Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on each date as required by Section4.02 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement; provided that each reference in each such representation and warranty to the Borrower’s knowledge shall, for purposes of this Section9, be deemed to be a reference to such Guarantor’s knowledge and (b)agrees to take, or refrain from taking, as the case may be, each action necessary to be taken or not taken, as the case may be, so that no Default or Event of Default is caused by the failure to take such action or to refrain from taking such action by such Guarantor.  
10. Reinstatement.

Delivery by telecopier or other electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Guaranty shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Guaranty.

15. Severability. Any provision of this Guaranty that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  
16. Integration. This Guaranty represents the agreement of each Guarantor and the Collateral Agent with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents (and each other agreement or instrument executed or issued in connection therewith).

17. Amendments in Writing; No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  
(a) None of the terms or provisions of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written instrument executed by the affected Guarantor(s) and the Collateral Agent in accordance with Section10.01 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement; provided, however, that this Guaranty may be supplemented (but no existing provisions may be modified) through agreements substantially in the form of Annex B, in each case duly executed by each Guarantor directly affected thereby.  
(b) Neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Term Loan Secured Party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section17(a) hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default or in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that the Collateral Agent or any Term Loan Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion.  
(c) The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.

The execution and delivery of any instrument adding an additional Guarantor as a party to this Guaranty shall not require the consent of any other Guarantor hereunder.

ANNEX B  
TO THE TERM LOAN GUARANTY  
SUPPLEMENT NO. [], dated as of [], 20[] (this “Supplement”), to the TERM LOAN GUARANTY, dated as of August4, 2014 (as the same may be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Guaranty”), made among, solely with respect to the obligations of the Guarantors under Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements, TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (as further defined in the Guaranty, the “Borrower”) and each of the subsidiaries of the Borrower party thereto from time to time (the Borrower, solely with respect to the obligations of the Guarantors under Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements, and each such subsidiary, individually, a “Guarantor” and, collectively, the “Guarantors”), and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., as collateral agent for the Term Loan Secured Parties (in such capacity, together with its successors and assigns in such capacity, the “Collateral Agent”).  
Reference is made to the Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of August4, 2014 (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”), among the Borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “Lenders”) and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent.  
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Guaranty. The rules of construction and other interpretative provisions specified in Section1(b) of the Guaranty shall apply to this Supplement, including terms defined in the preamble and recitals hereto.  
The Guarantors have entered into the Guaranty in order to induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into the Term Loan Credit Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make their Extensions of Credit to the Borrower under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, to induce one or more Hedge Banks to enter into Secured Hedge Agreements with any Loan Party and to induce one or more Cash Management Banks to provide cash management services pursuant to Secured Cash Management Agreements to any Loan Party. Section6.12 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Section20 of the Guaranty provide that additional Subsidiaries may become Guarantors under the Guaranty by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement. Each undersigned Subsidiary (each a “New Guarantor”) is executing this Supplement in accordance with the requirements of the Term Loan Credit Agreement to become a Guarantor under the Guaranty in order to induce the Lenders to make Extensions of Credit to the Borrower under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, to induce one or more Hedge Banks to enter into Secured Hedge Agreements with any Loan Party, to induce one or more Cash Management Banks to provide cash management services pursuant to Secured Cash Management Agreements to any Loan Party, and as consideration for Extensions of Credit previously made, Secured Hedge Agreements previously entered into and cash management services previously provided.  
B-1  
Accordingly, the Collateral Agent and each New Guarantor agrees as follows:  
In accordance with Section20 of the Guaranty, each New Guarantor by its signature below becomes a Guarantor under the Guaranty with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a Guarantor and each New Guarantor hereby (a)agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Guaranty applicable to it as a Guarantor thereunder and (b)represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made by it as a Guarantor thereunder are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date hereof (except to the extent that they expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date). Each reference to a Guarantor in the Guaranty shall be deemed to include each New Guarantor. The Guaranty is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Supplement or any provision of the Guaranty or any other Loan Document, the Guaranteed Obligations of any New Guarantor shall not extend to or include any Excluded Swap Obligation.  
Each New Guarantor represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties that this Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium or other Laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity.  
This Supplement may be executed in one or more counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier or other electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Supplement shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Supplement. The Collateral Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission. This Supplement shall become effective as to each New Guarantor when the Collateral Agent shall have received counterparts of this Supplement that, when taken together, bear the signatures of such New Guarantor and the Collateral Agent.  
Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect.  
B-2  
THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES ARE NOT MANDATORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.  
Any provision of this Supplement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof and in the Guaranty, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  
All notices, requests and demands pursuant hereto shall be made in accordance with Section13 of the Guaranty. All communications and notices hereunder to each New Guarantor shall be given to it in care of the Borrower at the Borrower’s address set forth in Section10.02 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
Each New Guarantor agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with this Supplement, including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel for the Collateral Agent to the extent required by Section10.04 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.

(b) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent at any time and from time to time to file in any relevant United States jurisdiction any initial financing statements with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof and amendments thereto and continuations thereof that contain the information required by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of each applicable jurisdiction for the filing of any financing statement or amendment or continuation, including whether such Grantor is an organization, the type of organization and any organizational identification number issued to such Grantor. Such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that describes such property in any other manner such as “all assets” or “all personal property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired” of such Grantor or words of similar effect as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail. Each Grantor agrees to provide such information to the Collateral Agent promptly upon request.  
Each Grantor further authorizes the Collateral Agent to file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or United States Copyright Office (or any successor office),  
 as applicable, such documents as may be necessary or advisable for the purpose of perfecting, confirming, continuing, enforcing, protecting or providing notice of the Security Interests granted by such Grantor hereunder.  
This Agreement secures the payment of all the respective Guaranteed Obligations of the Grantors. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement secures the payment of all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and would be owed to the Collateral Agent or the Term Loan Secured Parties but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving any Grantor.  
The Security Interests created hereby are granted as security only and shall not subject the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party to, or in any way alter or modify, any obligation or liability of any Grantor with respect to or arising out of the Collateral.  
(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is the understanding of the parties that the Liens granted pursuant to clause (a)above shall (i)with respect to Collateral other than Collateral constituting Term Loan Priority Collateral, (x)prior to the Discharge of ABL Obligations, be subject and subordinate, as and to the extent provided for in the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement, to the Liens granted to the ABL Agent for the benefit of the ABL Secured Parties to secure the ABL Obligations pursuant to the ABL Security Agreement and (y)prior to the Discharge of Additional ABL Obligations, be subject and subordinate, as and to the extent provided for in the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement, to the Liens granted to any Additional ABL Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Additional ABL Obligations to secure such Additional ABL Obligations pursuant to the Additional ABL Collateral Documents as and to the extent provided for therein, and (ii)with respect to all Collateral, prior to the Discharge of Additional Term Obligations, be pari passu and equal in priority to the Liens granted to any Additional Term Agent for the benefit of the holders of the applicable Additional Term Obligations to secure such Additional Term Obligations pursuant to the applicable Additional Term Collateral Documents (except, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), as may be separately otherwise agreed between the Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the Term Loan Secured Parties and any Additional Term Agent, on behalf of itself and the Additional Term Secured Parties, including pursuant to a Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement). The Collateral Agent acknowledges and agrees that the relative priority of the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, the ABL Agent and any Additional Agent shall be determined solely pursuant to the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, and not by priority as a matter of law or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Liens and security interest granted to the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the provisions of the applicable Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement  
 shall govern and control as among (i)the Collateral Agent, the ABL Agent and any Additional Agent, in the case of the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement, (ii)the Collateral Agent and Additional Term Loan Agent, in the case of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, and (iii)the Collateral Agent and any other secured creditor (or agent therefor) party thereto, in the case of any Other Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any such conflict, each Grantor may act (or omit to act) in accordance with such Intercreditor Agreement, and shall not be in breach, violation or default of its obligations hereunder by reason of doing so. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (x)for so long as any ABL Obligations or any Additional ABL Obligations remain outstanding, any obligation hereunder to deliver to the Collateral Agent any Collateral constituting ABL Priority Collateral shall be satisfied by causing such ABL Priority Collateral to be delivered to the ABL Agent or the applicable ABL Collateral Representative, to be held in accordance with the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement and (y)for so long as any Additional Term Obligations remain outstanding, any obligation hereunder to deliver to the Collateral Agent any Collateral shall be satisfied by causing such Collateral to be delivered to the applicable Collateral Representative to be held in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a  
 secured party upon default under the UCC (whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where such rights are exercised) or any other applicable law or in equity and also, to the extent permitted by applicable law, may without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind except as specified below, subject to any existing reserved rights or licenses, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange broker’s board or at any of the Collateral Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such price or prices and upon such other terms as are commercially reasonable irrespective of the impact of any such sales on the market price of the Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers of Collateral to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and, upon consummation of any such sale, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal that it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. The Collateral Agent or any Term Loan Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold and the Collateral Agent or such Term Loan Secured Party may, subject to (x)the satisfaction in full in cash of all payments due pursuant to Section8.04(a) of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and (y)the ratable satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the priorities set forth in Section8.04 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, pay the purchase price by crediting the amount thereof against the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days’ notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. To the extent permitted by law, each Grantor hereby waives any claim against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Collateral Agent’s request (subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement), to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Collateral Agent at places and times which the Collateral Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor’s premises or elsewhere. The Collateral Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section5.05 in  
 accordance with the provisions of Section8.04 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may, subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  
5.06 Deficiency. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay the Guaranteed Obligations and the reasonable fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Collateral Agent or any Term Loan Secured Party to collect such deficiency.  
5.07 Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; Waiver of Rights. Each Grantor shall (to the maximum extent permitted by law) remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Grantor and without notice to or further assent by any Grantor, (a)any demand for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations made by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party may be rescinded by such party and any of the Guaranteed Obligations continued, (b)the Guaranteed Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, (c)the Secured Debt Documents, and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Secured Debt Document and (d)any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Term Loan Secured Party shall have any obligation to protect, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for this Agreement or any property subject thereto. When making any demand hereunder against any Grantor, the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any other Grantor, and any failure by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any other Grantor or any release of the Borrower or any other Grantor shall not relieve any Grantor in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or any Grantor not so released of its several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party against any Grantor. For the purpose hereof “demand” shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.  
5.08 Conflict with Term Loan Credit Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Section5 and the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Credit Agreement shall prevail.  
6. 
The Collateral Agent.  
6.01 Collateral Agent’s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, etc.  
(a) Subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, each Grantor hereby appoints, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest, effective upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or otherwise, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, and the other Loan Documents, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and the other Loan Documents and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Collateral Agent the power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, either in the Collateral Agent’s name or in the name of such Grantor or otherwise, without assent by such Grantor, to do any or all of the following at the same time or at different times, in each case after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default:  
(i) take possession of and endorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any Account or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Collateral Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any Account or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable;  
(ii) in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request to evidence the Collateral Agent’s and the Term Loan Secured Parties’ Security Interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby;  
(iii) pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against any Collateral;  
(iv) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section5.05, any endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral;  
(v) obtain, pay and adjust insurance required to be maintained by such Grantor or paid to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement;  
(vi) solely with respect to an Event of Default pursuant to Sections 8.01(a), 8.01(f) and 8.01(g) of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, send verifications of Accounts to any Person who is or who may become obligated to any Grantor under, with respect to or on account of an Account;  
(vii) solely with respect to an Event of Default pursuant to Sections 8.01(a) and 8.01(f) of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, direct any party liable for any payment under any of the Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the Collateral Agent or as the Collateral Agent shall direct;  
(viii) ask or demand for, collect and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral;  
(ix) sign and endorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other documents in connection with any of the Collateral;  
(x) commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral;  
(xi) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral (with such Grantor’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the extent such action or its resolution could materially affect such Grantor or any of its Affiliates in any manner other than with respect to its continuing rights in such Collateral; provided that such consent right shall not limit any other rights or remedies available to the Collateral Agent at law);  
(xii) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Collateral Agent may deem appropriate (with such Grantor’s consent (not to be  
 unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the extent such action or its resolution could materially affect such Grantor or any of its Affiliates in any manner other than with respect to its continuing rights in such Collateral; provided that such consent right shall not limit any other rights or remedies available to the Collateral Agent at law);  
(xiii) subject to any existing reserved rights and licenses, assign, license or sublicense any Intellectual Property Collateral throughout the world for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Collateral Agent shall in its reasonable business discretion determine; and  
(xiv) generally, but subject to any existing reserved rights and licenses, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Collateral Agent’s option and such Grantor’s expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things that the Collateral Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Collateral Agent’s and the Term Loan Secured Parties’ Security Interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.  
Anything in this Section6.0l(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Collateral Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section6.01(a) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.  
(b) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Collateral Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.  
(c) The expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection with actions undertaken as permitted under this Section6.01, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the highest rate per annum at which interest would then be payable on any category of past due Base Rate Loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the Collateral Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the Collateral Agent on demand.  
(d) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorney shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the Security Interests created hereby are released.  
6.02 Duty of Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent’s sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession,  
 under Section9-207 of the UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Collateral Agent deals with similar property for its own account. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords its own property. Neither the Collateral Agent, any other Term Loan Secured Party nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties hereunder are solely to protect the Collateral Agent’s and the other Term Loan Secured Parties’ interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.  
6.03 Authority of Collateral Agent. Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Collateral Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Collateral Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Collateral Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties, be governed by this Agreement and such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Collateral Agent and the Grantors, the Collateral Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the applicable Term Loan Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.  
6.04 Security Interest Absolute. All rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Security Interests created hereby and all obligations of the Grantors hereunder shall (to the maximum extent permitted by law) be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a)any lack of validity or enforceability of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, any other Secured Debt Document, any agreement with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b)any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Term Loan Credit Agreement, any other Secured Debt Document, or any other agreement or instrument, (c)any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or  
 departure from any guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or (d)any other circumstance (other than a defense of payment or performance) that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Grantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or this Agreement.  
6.05 Continuing Security Interest; Assignments Under the Secured Debt Documents; Release.  
(a) This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon each Grantor and the successors and assigns thereof and shall inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns until the Release Date.  
(b) A Subsidiary Grantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder and the Security Interests in the Collateral of such Subsidiary Grantor created hereby shall be automatically released, upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as a result of which such Subsidiary Grantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower or otherwise becomes an Excluded Subsidiary.  
(c) The Security Interests in any Collateral created hereby shall be automatically released and such Collateral sold, free and clear of the Lien and Security Interests created hereby (w)upon any sale or other transfer by any Grantor of any Collateral that is permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (other than to another Grantor), (x)upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the Security Interests created hereby in any Collateral pursuant to Section10.01 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, (y)upon property constituting Excluded Property or (z)as otherwise provided in any applicable Intercreditor Agreement.  
(d) In connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a), (b)or (c), the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to any Grantor, at such Grantor’s expense, all documents that such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence or confirm such termination or release.  
6.06 Reinstatement. This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any other Grantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any other Grantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.  
7. 
Miscellaneous.  
7.01 Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written instrument executed by the affected Grantor and the Collateral Agent in accordance with Section10.01 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement; provided, however, that this Agreement may be supplemented (but no existing provisions may be modified and no Collateral may be released) through agreements substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 in each case duly executed by each Grantor directly effected thereby.  
7.02 Notices. All notices, requests and demands pursuant hereto shall be made in accordance with Section10.02 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Subsidiary Grantor shall be given to it in care of the Borrower at the Borrower’s address set forth in Section10.02 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
7.03 No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Term Loan Secured Party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section7.01 hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Event of Default or in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof or of any other applicable Secured Debt Document. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that the Collateral Agent or such other Term Loan Secured Party would otherwise have on any other occasion. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.  
7.04 Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification.  
(a) Each Grantor agrees to pay any and all reasonable and documented or invoiced expenses (including all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that may be paid or incurred by any Term Loan Secured Party in enforcing, or obtaining advice of counsel in respect of, any rights with respect to, or collecting, any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations and/or enforcing any rights with respect to, or collecting against, such Grantor under this Agreement, in each case to the extent the Borrower would be required to do so pursuant to Section10.04 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
(b) Each Grantor agrees to pay, and to save the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties harmless from, any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise, property, intangible or mortgage recording taxes, charges or similar levies which may be payable or determined to be payable with respect to any of the Collateral or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(c) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Loan Documents, each Grantor agrees to pay, and to save the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties harmless from, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, in each case to the extent the Borrower would be required to do so pursuant to Section10.05 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
(d) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Guaranteed Obligations secured hereby and by the other Collateral Documents. The agreements in this Section7.04 shall survive termination of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or, any other Loan Document or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party. All amounts due under this Section7.04 shall be payable within 30 days after demand therefor.  
7.05 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and by the Term Loan Credit Agreement, except that no Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent, except pursuant to a transaction or otherwise as permitted by the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
7.06 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier or other electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. The Collateral Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission.  
7.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  
7.08 Section Headings. The Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.  
7.09 Integration. This Agreement together with the other Loan Documents represents the agreement of each of the Grantors with respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Secured Debt Documents (and each other agreement or instrument executed or issued in connection therewith).  
7.10 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES ARE NOT MANDATORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.  
7.11 Submission to Jurisdiction Waivers. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:  
(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York (the “New York Supreme Court”), and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Federal District Court,” and together with the New York Supreme Court, the “New York Courts”) and appellate courts from either of them and agrees that any such action or proceeding shall be brought solely in such New York Courts; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or operate to preclude (i)the Collateral Agent from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any other jurisdiction to realize on the Collateral or any other security for the Guaranteed Obligations (in which case any party shall be entitled to assert any claim or defense, including any claim or defense that this Section7.11 would otherwise require to be asserted in a legal action or proceeding in a New York Court), or to enforce a judgment or other court order in favor of the Collateral Agent, (ii)any party from bringing any legal action or proceeding in any jurisdiction for the recognition and enforcement of any judgment, (iii)if all such New York Courts decline jurisdiction over any person, or decline (or, in the  
 case of the Federal District Court, lack) jurisdiction over any subject matter of such action or proceeding, a legal action or proceeding may be brought with respect thereto in another court having jurisdiction and (iv)in the event a legal action or proceeding is brought against any party hereto or involving any of its assets or property in another court (without any collusive assistance by such party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates), such party from asserting a claim or defense (including any claim or defense that this Section7.11 would otherwise require to be asserted in a legal action or proceeding in a New York Court) in any such action or proceeding;  
(b) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (a)of this section;  
(c) consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section7.02; and  
(d) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section7.11 any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages;  
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any court referred to in paragraph (a)above.  
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any manner permitted by applicable law.  
7.12 Acknowledgments. Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that:  
(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party;  
(b) neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Term Loan Secured Party has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Grantor arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Grantors, on the one hand, and the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor;  
(c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Term Loan Secured Parties or among the Grantors and the Term Loan Secured Parties; and  
(d) upon any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may proceed without notice, against any Grantor and any Collateral to collect and recover the full amount of any Obligation then due, without first proceeding against any other Grantor, any other Loan Party or any other Collateral and without first joining any other Grantor or any other Loan Party in any proceeding.  
7.13 Additional Grantors. Each Subsidiary of the Borrower that is required to become a party to this Agreement pursuant to Section6.12 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement shall become a Grantor, with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Grantor herein, for all purposes of this Agreement upon execution and delivery by such Subsidiary of a Supplement substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 hereto. The execution and delivery of any instrument adding an additional Grantor as a party to this Agreement shall not require the consent of any other Grantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Grantor as a party to this Agreement.  
7.14 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 7.14 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  
7.15 Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of any Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the provisions of such Intercreditor Agreement shall prevail.

SECTION 5. Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Security Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  
SECTION 6. THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES ARE NOT MANDATORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.  
SECTION 7. Any provision of this Supplement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof and in the Security Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

The Collateral Agent acknowledges and agrees that the relative priority of the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, the ABL Agent and any Additional Agent shall be determined solely pursuant to the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, and not by priority as a matter of law or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Liens and security interest granted to the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the provisions of the applicable Intercreditor Agreements. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control as among (i)the Collateral Agent, the ABL Agent and any Additional Agent, in the case of the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement, (ii)the Collateral Agent and the Junior Agent, in the case of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (iii)the Collateral Agent and any other secured creditor (or agent therefor) party thereto, in the case of any Other Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any such conflict, each Pledgor may act (or omit to act) in accordance with such Intercreditor Agreement, and shall not be in breach, violation or default of its obligations hereunder by reason of doing so. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (x)for so long as ABL Obligations or any Additional Obligations remain outstanding, any obligation hereunder to deliver to the Collateral Agent any ABL Priority Collateral shall be satisfied by causing such ABL Priority Collateral to be delivered to the ABL Agent or the applicable ABL Collateral Representative to be held in accordance with the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement and (y)for so long as any Additional Term Obligations remain outstanding, any obligation hereunder to deliver to the Collateral Agent any Collateral shall be satisfied by causing such Collateral to be delivered to the applicable Collateral Representative to be held in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement.  
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Collateral, together with all right, title, interest, powers, privileges and preferences pertaining or incidental thereto, unto the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Term Loan Secured Parties; subject, however, to the terms, covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth.  
3. Security for the Obligations. This Agreement secures the payment of all the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement secures the payment of all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed to the Collateral Agent or the Term Loan Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving any Pledgor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any provision of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Guaranteed Obligations of any Pledgor shall not extend to or include any Excluded Swap Obligation (as defined in the Term Loan Guaranty).  
4. Delivery of the Collateral. Subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, all certificates or instruments, if any, representing or evidencing the Collateral (other than instruments evidencing Indebtedness of an aggregate principal amount of less than $5,000,000) shall be promptly delivered (or otherwise delivered within the time periods required by the Term Loan Credit Agreement with respect to any delivery in connection with the formation or acquisition (within the meaning of Section6.12 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement) of any Subsidiary) to and held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent pursuant hereto to the extent required by Section6.12 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement (provided that any Collateral required to be delivered other than in connection with the formation or acquisition (within the meaning of Section6.12 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Section9(b) of this Agreement) of any Subsidiary shall not be required to be delivered prior to the end of the fiscal quarter during which such Collateral was acquired by any Pledgor). Such Collateral shall be in suitable form for transfer by delivery, or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. Subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and without notice to any Pledgor (except as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by law), to transfer to or to register in the name of the Collateral Agent or any of its nominees any or all of the Pledged Shares. Subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Pledgor will promptly give to the Collateral Agent copies of any notices or other communications received by it with respect to Pledged Shares registered in the name of such Pledgor. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to exchange the certificates representing Pledged Shares held by it for certificates of smaller or larger denominations for any purpose consistent with this Agreement.  
5. Representations and Warranties. Each Pledgor represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent and each other Term Loan Secured Party that:  
(a) Schedule 2 hereto correctly represents as of the date hereof (A)the issuer, the issuer’s jurisdiction of formation, the certificate number, if any, the Pledgor and the record owner, the number and class and the percentage of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of such class of all Pledged Shares, in each case with respect to the Pledged Shares pledged or assigned by such Pledgor and (B)the issuer, the issuer’s jurisdiction, the initial principal amount, the Pledgor and holder, date of issuance and maturity date of all Pledged Debt, in each case pledged or assigned by such Pledgor. Except as set forth on Schedule 2, the Pledged Shares pledged or assigned by such Pledgor represent all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each class of Equity Interests (or 65% of all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests in the case of pledges of voting Equity Interests in Foreign Subsidiaries or any FSHCO in each case held directly by a Loan Party) in the issuer on the date hereof.  
(b) Such Pledgor is the legal and beneficial owner of the Collateral pledged or assigned by such Pledgor hereunder free and clear of any Lien, except for the Liens created by this Agreement and Liens permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Pledged Shares pledged by such Pledgor hereunder have been duly authorized and validly issued and, in the case of Pledged Shares issued by a corporation, are fully paid and non-assessable.  
(d) Except for restrictions and limitations imposed or permitted by the Loan Documents (including any Intercreditor Agreement) or imposed by securities laws, the Collateral pledged, transferred or assigned by such Pledgor is freely transferable and assignable, and none of the Collateral is subject to any option, right of first refusal, shareholders agreement, charter or bylaw provisions or contractual restriction of any nature that might prohibit, impair, delay or otherwise affect the pledge of such Collateral hereunder, the sale or disposition thereof pursuant hereto or the exercise by the Collateral Agent of rights and remedies hereunder.  
(e) No material consent or approval of any Governmental Authority, any securities exchange or any other Person was or is necessary to the validity of the pledge effected hereby (other than such as have been obtained and are in full force and effect or, such consents or approvals the failure of which to obtain would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect).  
(f) The execution and delivery by such Pledgor of this Agreement and the pledge of the Collateral pledged by such Pledgor hereunder pursuant hereto create  
 a valid and enforceable security interest in such Collateral and (i)in the case of certificates or instruments representing or evidencing the Collateral, upon the earlier of (x)delivery of such Collateral to the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement and (y)the filing of the applicable Uniform Commercial Code financing statements described in Section3.03(a) of the Term Loan Security Agreement and (ii)in the case of all other Collateral, upon the filing of the applicable Uniform Commercial Code financing statements described in Section3.03(a) of the Term Loan Security Agreement, (1)shall create a perfected security interest in such Collateral, subject to no Liens, other than the Liens described in Section5(b), prior to all other Liens on the Collateral of such Pledgor other than Liens having priority over or being pari passu with the Collateral Agent’s Lien as described in Section2, by operation of law or otherwise as permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, securing the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Term Loan Secured Parties, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or law) and (2)with respect to any such certificates or instruments representing or evidencing the Collateral, (A)the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, will have “control” (as defined in the UCC) thereof and (B)assuming the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, does not have notice of any adverse claim to such Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt (it being understood and agreed that as of the Closing Date, the Collateral Agent does not have notice of any adverse claim to such Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt), the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement will be a protected purchaser (within the meaning of UCC Section8-303) thereof.  
(g) Such Pledgor has full power, authority and legal right to pledge all the Collateral pledged by such Pledgor pursuant to this Agreement and this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Pledgor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or law).  
(h) The issuers listed on Schedule 2 include all direct wholly owned Subsidiaries (other than Subsidiaries all of whose Equity Interests are Excluded Equity Interests) of such Pledgor as of the Closing Date.  
(i) The Pledged Debt constitutes all of the outstanding Indebtedness owed to such Pledgor as of the Closing Date and required to be pledged pursuant to Section9(b) of this Agreement.  
6. Certification of Limited Liability Company Interests, Limited Partnership Interests. Unless otherwise consented to by the Collateral Agent, Equity Interests required to be pledged hereunder in any Domestic Subsidiary that is organized as a limited liability company or limited partnership and pledged hereunder shall either (i)be represented by a certificate or (ii)not have elected to be treated as a “security” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code and shall not be represented by a certificate; provided that such Pledgor shall at no time elect to treat any such interest as a “security” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, nor shall such interest be represented by a certificate, unless such interest is thereafter represented by a certificate that is promptly delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms hereof.  
7. Further Assurances. Each Pledgor agrees that at any time and from time to time, at the expense of such Pledgor, subject to the Perfection Exceptions and the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, it will execute or otherwise authorize the filing of any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements), which may be required under any Law, or which the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order (x)to perfect and protect any pledge, assignment or security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby (including the priority thereof) or (y)to enable the Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral.  
8. Voting Rights; Dividends and Distributions; Etc.  
(a) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:  
(i) Each Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other rights pertaining to the Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents;  
(ii) The Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to each Pledgor all such proxies and other instruments as such Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Pledgor to exercise the voting and other rights that it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (i)above and to receive the dividends, distributions and redemptions that it is authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section8(b).  
(b) Subject to paragraph (c)below, each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain and use, free and clear of the Lien of this Agreement, any and all dividends, distributions, redemptions, principal and interest made or paid in respect of the Collateral to the extent not prohibited by any Loan Document; provided, however, that, any and all noncash dividends, interest, principal or other distributions that would constitute Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt, whether resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the outstanding Equity Interests of the issuer of any Pledged Shares or received in exchange for Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt or any part thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, consolidation, acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or otherwise, shall be (to the extent not constituting Excluded Equity Interests), and shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement to hold as, Collateral and shall, if received by such Pledgor, be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, be segregated from the other property or funds of such Pledgor and be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement); provided further that, subject to Section6.12 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, no such delivery to the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, shall be required to be made prior to the end of the fiscal quarter during which any such Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt were received by such Pledgor.  
(c) Subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, upon written notice to the Pledgors by the Collateral Agent following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default:  
(i) all rights of such Pledgor to exercise or refrain from exercising the voting and other rights that it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section8(a)(i) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise or refrain from exercising such voting and other rights during the continuation of such Event of Default; provided that, unless otherwise directed by the Required Lenders, subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall have the right from time to time following the occurrence  
 and during the continuation of an Event of Default to permit the Pledgors to exercise such rights. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived or otherwise cease to be continuing and the Borrower has delivered to the Collateral Agent a certificate to that effect, each Pledgor will have the right to exercise the voting and consensual rights that such Pledgor would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to the terms of Section8(a)(i) (and the obligations of the Collateral Agent under Section8(a)(ii) shall be reinstated);  
(ii) all rights of such Pledgor to receive the dividends, distributions and principal and interest payments that such Pledgor would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section8(b) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, which shall thereupon have the sole right to receive and hold as Collateral such dividends, distributions and principal and interest payments during the continuation of such Event of Default. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived or otherwise cease to be continuing and the Borrower has delivered to the Collateral Agent a certificate to that effect, the Collateral Agent shall repay to each Pledgor (without interest) and each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive, retain and use all dividends, distributions and principal and interest payments that such Pledgor would otherwise be permitted to receive, retain and use pursuant to the terms of Section8(b);  
(iii) all dividends, distributions and principal and interest payments that are received by such Pledgor contrary to the provisions of Section8(c)(ii) shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Pledgor and shall forthwith be delivered to the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsements); and  
(iv) in order to permit the Collateral Agent to exercise the voting and other consensual rights that it may be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section8(c)(i), and to receive all dividends, distributions and principal and interest payments that it may be entitled to under Sections 8(c)(ii) and (c)(iii), such Pledgor shall from time to time execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent, appropriate proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request.  
(d) The Collateral Agent may suspend the rights of one or more of the Pledgors under paragraph (a)(i) or paragraph (b)of this Section8 in part without suspending all  
 such rights (as specified by the Collateral Agent in its sole and absolute discretion) and without waiving or otherwise affecting the Collateral Agent’s rights to give additional notices from time to time suspending other rights so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  
9. Transfers and Other Liens; Additional Collateral; Etc. Each Pledgor shall:  
(a) not (i)except as permitted by the Term Loan Credit Agreement (including pursuant to waivers and consents thereunder), sell or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option or warrant with respect to, any of the Collateral or (ii)create or suffer to exist any consensual Lien upon or with respect to any of the Collateral, except for the Liens created by this Agreement, the Term Loan Security Agreement and the Liens permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement; provided that in the event such Pledgor sells or otherwise disposes of assets as permitted by the Term Loan Credit Agreement (including pursuant to waivers and consents thereunder) and such assets are or include any of the Collateral, the Collateral Agent shall release such Collateral to such Pledgor free and clear of the Lien created by this Agreement concurrently with the consummation of such sale in accordance with Section9.11 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, and with Section14 hereof;  
(b) subject to Section4 hereof, deliver (i)all Equity Interests (other than Excluded Equity Interests) in its wholly owned Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii)all Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness constituting Excluded Property (other than clause (a)of the definition thereof)) evidenced by promissory notes or other instruments from time to time owed to such Pledgor;  
(c) use commercially reasonable efforts to defend its and the Collateral Agent’s title or interest in and to all the Collateral (and in the Proceeds thereof) against any and all Liens (other than the Liens permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Liens created by this Agreement and the Term Loan Security Agreement), however arising, and any and all Persons whomsoever and, subject to Section9.11 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Section14 hereof, to maintain and preserve the Lien and security interest created by this Agreement until the Release Date.  
10. Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, each Pledgor hereby appoints, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest, the Collateral Agent as such Pledgor’s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such Pledgor or otherwise, to take any action and to execute any instrument, in each case after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, that the Collateral Agent may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement,  
 including to receive, indorse and collect all instruments made payable to such Pledgor representing any dividend, distribution or principal or interest payment in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same.  
11. The Collateral Agent’s Duties. To the extent permitted by law, the powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest and the interests of the Term Loan Secured Parties in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Pledged Shares, whether or not the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent accords its own property.  
12. Remedies. Subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:  
(a) The Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction and also, to the extent permitted by applicable law, may without notice, except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange broker’s board or at any of the Collateral Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such price or prices and upon such other terms as are commercially reasonable irrespective of the impact of any such sales on the market price of the Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers of Collateral to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and, upon consummation of any such sale, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal that it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. The Collateral Agent or any Term Loan Secured  
 Party shall have the right upon any such public sale, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale, to purchase all or any part of the Collateral so sold and the Collateral Agent or such other Term Loan Secured Party may, subject to (x)the satisfaction in full of all payments due pursuant to Section8.04(a) of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and (y)the satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the priorities set forth in Section8.04 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, pay the purchase price by crediting the amount thereof against the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Pledgor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days’ notice to such Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. To the extent permitted by law, each Pledgor hereby waives any claim against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.  
(b) The Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the Collateral at any time after receipt pursuant to Section8.04 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
(c) The Collateral Agent may exercise any and all rights and remedies of each Pledgor in respect of the Collateral.  
(d) All payments received by any Pledgor after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default in respect of the Collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Pledgor and shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement).  
(e) If the Collateral Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any of the Pledged Shares pursuant to this Section12, each Pledgor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the Pledged Shares, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act  
 of 1933, as from time to time amended (the “Securities Act”) and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Shares for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so.  
(f) If the Collateral Agent determines to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Collateral, upon written request, each Pledgor shall, from time to time, furnish to the Collateral Agent all such information as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request in order to determine the number of shares and other instruments included in the Collateral which may be sold by the Collateral Agent as exempt transactions under the Securities Act and rules of the SEC, as the same are from time to time in effect.  
13. Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; Waiver of Rights. Except for the termination of a Pledgor’s obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section14, each Pledgor shall (to the maximum extent permitted by law) remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Pledgor and without notice to or further assent by any Pledgor, (a)any demand for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations made by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party may be rescinded by such party and any of the Guaranteed Obligations continued, (b)the Guaranteed Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, (c)the Secured Debt Documents and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Secured Debt Document and (d)any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Term Loan Secured Party shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for this Agreement or any property subject thereto. When making any demand hereunder  
 against any Pledgor, the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower (to the extent such demand is in respect of any Obligations owing by the Borrower) or any other Pledgor or pledgor, and any failure by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any other Pledgor or pledgor or any release of the Borrower or any other Pledgor or pledgor shall not relieve any Pledgor in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or any Pledgor not so released of its several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party against any Pledgor. For the purposes hereof “demand” shall include the commencement and continuation of any legal proceedings.  
14. Continuing Security Interest; Assignments Under the Secured Debt Documents; Release.  
(a) This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon each Pledgor and the successors and assigns thereof and shall inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Term Loan Secured Parties and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns until the Release Date.  
(b) A Subsidiary Pledgor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder and the Security Interests in the Collateral of such Subsidiary Pledgor created hereby shall be automatically released as it relates to the Guaranteed Obligations, upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as a result of which such Subsidiary Pledgor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower or otherwise becomes an Excluded Subsidiary.  
(c) The Security Interests in any Collateral created hereby shall be automatically released and such Collateral may be sold free and clear of the Lien and Security Interests created hereby (w)upon any sale or other transfer by any Pledgor of any Collateral that is permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (other than to another Pledgor), (x)upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the Security Interests created hereby in any Collateral pursuant to Section10.01 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, (y)upon such property constituting Excluded Equity Interests or other Excluded Property (other than clause (a)of the definition thereof) and (z)as otherwise provided in any applicable Intercreditor Agreement.  
(d) In connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a), (b)or (c), the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to any Pledgor or authorize the filing of, at such Pledgor’s expense, all documents that such Pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence or confirm such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section14 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Collateral Agent.  
15. Reinstatement. This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any other Pledgor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any other Pledgor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.  
16. Notices. All notices, requests and demands pursuant hereto shall be made in accordance with Section10.02 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Subsidiary Pledgor shall be given to it in care of the Borrower at the Borrower’s address set forth in Section10.02 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier or other electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Pledge Agreement shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Pledge Agreement. The Collateral Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission.  
18. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  
19. Integration. This Agreement together with the other Loan Documents represents the agreement of each of the Pledgors, the Collateral Agent and the Term Loan Secured Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Pledgors, the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Secured Debt Documents (and each other agreement or instrument executed or issued in connection therewith).  
20. Amendments in Writing; No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  
(a) None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written instrument executed by the affected Pledgor(s) and the Collateral Agent in accordance with Section10.01 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement; provided, however, that this Agreement may be supplemented (but no existing provisions may be modified and no Collateral may be released) through agreements substantially in the form of Annex A, in each case duly executed by each Pledgor directly effected thereby.  
(b) Neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Term Loan Secured Party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section20(a) hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default or in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof or of any other applicable Secured Debt Document. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Collateral Agent or any other Term Loan Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that the Collateral Agent or such other Term Loan Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion.  
(c) The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.

Each of Section6.03, Section6.04, Section7.04 and Section7.12 of the Term Loan Security Agreement are incorporated herein, mutatis mutandis (to apply to this Agreement rather than to the Term Loan Security Agreement and to the Pledgors rather than to the Grantors).  
22. Section Headings. The Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.  
23. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and by the Term Loan Credit Agreement, except that no Pledgor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent, except pursuant to a transaction or otherwise as permitted by the Term Loan Credit Agreement.  
24. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 24 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  
25. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:  
(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York (the “New York Supreme Court”), and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Federal District Court,” and together with the New York Supreme Court, the “New York Courts”) and appellate courts from either of them and agrees that any such action or proceeding shall be brought solely in such New York Courts; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or operate to preclude (i)the Collateral Agent from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any other jurisdiction to realize on the Collateral or any other security for the Guaranteed Obligations (in which case any party shall be entitled to assert any claim or defense, including any claim or defense that this Section25 would otherwise require to be asserted in a legal action or proceeding in a New York Court), or to enforce a judgment or other court order in favor of the Collateral Agent, (ii)any party from bringing any legal action or proceeding in any jurisdiction for the recognition and enforcement of any judgment, (iii)if all such New York Courts decline jurisdiction over any person, or decline (or, in the case of the Federal District Court, lack) jurisdiction over any subject matter of such action or proceeding, a legal action or proceeding may be brought with respect thereto in another court having jurisdiction and (iv)in the event a legal action or proceeding is brought against any party hereto or involving any of its assets or property in another court (without any collusive assistance by such party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates), such party from asserting a claim or defense  
 (including any claim or defense that this Section25 would otherwise require to be asserted in a legal action or proceeding in a New York Court) in any such action or proceeding;  
(b) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (a)of this section.  
(c) consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section16; and  
(d) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section25 any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.  
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any court referred to in paragraph (a)above. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any manner permitted by applicable law.  
26. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES ARE NOT MANDATORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.  
27. Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of any Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the provisions of such Intercreditor Agreement shall prevail.  
28. Financing Statements. Each Pledgor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent at any time and from time to time to file in any relevant jurisdiction any initial financing statements with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof and amendments thereto and continuations thereof that contain the information required by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of each applicable jurisdiction for the filing of any financing statement or amendment or continuation, including whether such Pledgor is an organization, the type of organization and any organizational identification number issued to such Pledgor. Such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of  
 collateral that describes such property in any other manner such as “all assets” or “all personal property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired” of such Pledgor or words of similar effect as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail. Each Pledgor agrees to provide such information to the Collateral Agent promptly upon request.

For purposes of the Pledge Agreement, (x)the Collateral shall be deemed to include the Additional Collateral, (y)the After-acquired Shares shall be deemed to include the After-acquired Additional Pledged Shares and (z)the After-acquired Debt shall be deemed to include the Additional Pledged Debt.  
SECTION 2. [Each Additional Pledgor by its signature below becomes a Pledgor under the Pledge Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a Pledgor and each Additional Pledgor hereby agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Pledge Agreement applicable to it as a Pledgor thereunder. Each reference to a “Subsidiary Pledgor” or a “Pledgor” in the Pledge Agreement shall be deemed to include each Additional Pledgor. The Pledge Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference.]7  
SECTION [2][3]. Each Additional Pledgor represents and warrants as follows:  
(b) Schedule 1 hereto (i)correctly represents as of the date hereof (A)the issuer, the issuer’s jurisdiction of formation, the certificate number, if any, the Additional Pledgor and the record owner, the number and class and the percentage of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of such class of all

(f) No material consent or approval of any Governmental Authority, any securities exchange or any other Person was or is necessary to the validity of the pledge effected hereby (other than such as have been obtained and are in full force and effect or, with respect to the pledge of Equity Interests in Foreign Subsidiaries, such consents or approvals the failure of which to obtain would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect).  
(g) The execution and delivery by such Pledgor of this Supplement and the pledge of the Additional Collateral pledged or assigned by such Pledgor hereunder pursuant hereto create a valid and enforceable security interest in such  
 Additional Collateral and (i)in the case of certificates or instruments representing or evidencing the Additional Collateral, upon the earlier of (x)delivery of such Additional Collateral to the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, this Supplement and the Pledge Agreement) and (y)the filing of the applicable Uniform Commercial Code financing statements described in Section3.03(a) of the Term Loan Security Agreement and (ii)in the case of all other Collateral, upon the filing of the applicable Uniform Commercial Code financing statements described in Section3.03(a) of the Term Loan Security Agreement, (1)shall create a perfected security interest in such Additional Collateral, subject to no Liens, other than the Liens described in Section5(b) of the Pledge Agreement, prior to all other Liens on the Additional Collateral of such Pledgor other than Liens having priority over or being pari passu with the Collateral Agent’s Lien by operation of law or otherwise as permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, securing the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Term Loan Secured Parties, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or law) and (2)with respect to any such certificates or instruments representing or evidencing the Collateral, (A)the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement will have “control” (as described in the UCC) thereof and (B)assuming the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement does not have notice of any adverse claim to such Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt (it being understood and agreed that as of the date hereof, the Collateral Agent does not have notice of any adverse claim to such Pledged Shares or Pledged Debt), the Collateral Agent, the applicable Collateral Representative or any Additional Agent, as applicable (or their respective agents appointed for the purposes of perfection), in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement will be a protected purchaser (within the meaning of UCC Section8-303) thereof.  
(h) Such Additional Pledgor has full power, authority and legal right to pledge or assign all the Additional Collateral pledged or assigned by such Additional Pledgor pursuant to this Supplement and this Supplement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Additional Pledgor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or law).

This Supplement may be executed in one or more counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier or other electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Pledge Agreement shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Pledge Agreement. The Collateral Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission.  
SECTION [4][5]. Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Pledge Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  
SECTION [5][6]. THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES ARE NOT MANDATORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.  
SECTION [6][7]. Any provision of this Supplement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof and in the Pledge Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE  
Date: , 2014  
To the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders party to the Credit Agreement referred to below:  
I, the undersigned chief financial officer of Tribune Publishing Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), in that capacity only and not in my individual capacity (and without personal liability), do hereby certify as of the date hereof, and based upon facts and circumstances as they exist as of the date hereof (and disclaiming any responsibility for changes in such facts and circumstances after the date hereof), that:  
1. This certificate is furnished to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section4.01(a)(v) of that certain Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of August4, 2014, among the Borrower, the Lenders from time to time party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this certificate shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.  
2. For purposes of this certificate, the terms below shall have the following definitions:  
(a) “Fair Value”  
The amount at which the assets (both tangible and intangible), in their entirety, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, within a commercially reasonable period of time, each having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts, with neither being under any compulsion to act.  
(b) “Present Fair Salable Value”  
The amount that could be obtained by an independent willing seller from an independent willing buyer if the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole are sold with reasonable promptness in an arm’s-length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises insofar as such conditions can be reasonably evaluated.  
(c) “Liabilities”  
The recorded liabilities (including contingent liabilities that would be recorded in accordance with GAAP) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the date hereof after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.  
Form of Solvency Certificate  
I-1  
(d) “Will be able to pay their Liabilities as they mature”  
For the period from the date hereof through the Maturity Date, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis taken as a whole will have sufficient assets and cash flow to pay their Liabilities as those liabilities mature or (in the case of contingent Liabilities) otherwise become payable, in light of business conducted or anticipated to be conducted by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as reflected in the projected financial statements and in light of the anticipated credit capacity.  
(e) “Do not have Unreasonably Small Capital”  
The Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis taken as a whole after consummation of the Transactions is a going concern and has sufficient capital to reasonably ensure that it will continue to be a going concern for the period from the date hereof through the Maturity Date. I understand that “unreasonably small capital” depends upon the nature of the particular business or businesses conducted or to be conducted, and I have reached my conclusion based on the needs and anticipated needs for capital of the business conducted or anticipated to be conducted by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as reflected in the projected financial statements and in light of the anticipated credit capacity.  
3. For purposes of this certificate, I, or officers of the Borrower under my direction and supervision, have performed the following procedures as of and for the periods set forth below.  
(a) I have reviewed the financial statements (including the pro forma financial statements) referred to in Section4.01(j) of the Credit Agreement.  
(b) I have knowledge of and have reviewed to my satisfaction the Credit Agreement.  
(c) As chief financial officer of the Borrower, I am familiar with the financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.  
4. Based on and subject to the foregoing, I hereby certify on behalf of the Borrower that after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, it is my opinion that (i)the Fair Value of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis taken as a whole exceeds their Liabilities, (ii)the Present Fair Salable Value of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis taken as a whole exceeds their Liabilities; (iii)the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis taken as a whole do not have Unreasonably Small Capital; and (iv)the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole will be able to pay their Liabilities as they mature.

 to in Section2(a) and give acquittance therefor and to file claims and proofs of claim and take such other action (including, without limitation, voting the Subordinated Debt or enforcing any security interest or other lien securing payment of the Subordinated Debt) as it may deem necessary or advisable for the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights or interests of the Administrative Agent or the Secured Parties; and  
(ii) each Subordinated Creditor shall duly and promptly take such action as the Administrative Agent may request (A)to collect the Subordinated Debt for the account of the Secured Parties and to file appropriate claims or proofs or claim in respect of the Subordinated Debt, (B)to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such powers of attorney, assignments, or other instruments as the Administrative Agent may request in order to enable the Administrative Agent to enforce any and all claims with respect to, and any security interests and other liens securing payment of, the Subordinated Debt, and (C)to collect and receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to the Subordinated Debt.  
(b) All payments or distributions upon or with respect to the Subordinated Debt which are received by each Subordinated Creditor contrary to the provisions of this Intercompany Subordination Agreement shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties, shall be segregated from other funds and property held by such Subordinated Creditor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Secured Parties in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement) to be applied (in the case of cash) to, or held as collateral (in the case of non-cash property or securities) for, the payment or prepayment of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  
(c) The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to demand specific performance of this Intercompany Subordination Agreement, whether or not any Obligor shall have complied with any of the provisions hereof applicable to it, at any time when any Subordinated Creditor shall have failed to comply with any of the provisions of this Intercompany Subordination Agreement applicable to it. Each Subordinated Creditor hereby irrevocably waives any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law, which might be asserted as a bar to such remedy of specific performance.

Section8. Obligations Hereunder Not Affected. All rights and interests of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder, and all agreements and obligations of each Subordinated Creditor and each Obligor under this Intercompany Subordination Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:

(xi) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.  
This Intercompany Subordination Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Obligor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

(h) The ABL Obligations, the Term Loan Obligations and any Additional Obligations may be refunded, replaced or refinanced, in whole or in part, in each case, without notice to, or the consent (except to the extent a consent is required to permit the refunding, replacement or refinancing transaction under any ABL Document, any Term Loan Document or any Additional Document) of the ABL Agent, the ABL Secured Parties, the Term Loan Agent or the Term Loan Secured Parties, any Additional Agent or any Additional Secured Parties, as the case may be, all without affecting the Lien Priorities provided for herein or the other provisions hereof; provided, however, that, if the indebtedness refunding, replacing or refinancing any such ABL Obligations, Term Loan Obligations or Additional Obligations is to constitute ABL Obligations, Term Loan Obligations or Additional Obligations governed by this Agreement, the holders of such indebtedness (or an authorized agent or trustee on their behalf) bind themselves in writing to the terms of this Agreement pursuant to a joinder agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto or otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the ABL Agent, the Term Loan Agent or any Additional Agent (other than any Designated Silent Agent), as the case may be (or, if there is no continuing Agent other than any Designated Silent Agent, as designated by the Company), and any such refunding, replacement or refinancing

No priority or right of the Term Loan Agent or any Term Loan Secured Party shall at any time be prejudiced or  
101  
 impaired in any way by any act or failure to act on the part of any Credit Party or by the noncompliance by any Person with the terms, provisions, or covenants of any of the Term Loan Documents, regardless of any knowledge thereof which the Term Loan Agent or any Term Loan Secured Party may have.

If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Additional Term Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect in the event of such Additional Term Recovery, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair, or otherwise affect the obligations of the Parties from such date of reinstatement.

Insolvency Proceedings  
Section6.1 DIP Financing. (a)If any Credit Party shall be subject to any Insolvency Proceeding in the United States at any time prior to the Discharge of ABL Collateral Obligations, and the ABL Agent or any ABL Credit Agreement Lenders, or any Additional ABL Agent or any Additional ABL Credit Facility Lenders shall agree to provide any Credit Party with, or consent to a third party providing, any Credit Party with any financing under Section364 of the Bankruptcy Code or consent to any order for the use of cash collateral under Section363 of the Bankruptcy Code (“DIP Financing”), with such DIP Financing to be secured by all or any portion of the Collateral (including assets that, but for the application of Section552 of the Bankruptcy Code would be Collateral), then the Term Loan Agent, on behalf of itself and the Term Loan Secured Parties, agrees that it will raise no objection, and will not directly or indirectly support or act in concert with any other party in raising an objection, to such DIP Financing or to the Liens securing the same on the grounds of a failure to provide “adequate protection” for the Liens of the Term Loan Agent securing the Term Loan Obligations or on any other grounds (and will not request any adequate protection solely as a result of such DIP Financing), so long as (i)the Term Loan Agent retains its Lien on the Collateral to secure the Term Loan Obligations (in each case, including Proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code) and, as to the Term Loan Priority Collateral only, such Lien has the same priority as existed prior to the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code and any Lien securing such DIP Financing is junior and subordinate to the Lien of the Term Loan Agent on the Term Loan Priority Collateral, (ii)all Liens on ABL Priority Collateral securing any such DIP Financing shall be senior to or on a parity with the Liens of the ABL Agent and the ABL Secured Parties securing the ABL Obligations, and the Liens of any Additional ABL Agent and Additional ABL Secured Parties securing the Additional ABL Obligations, on ABL Priority Collateral, (iii)if the ABL Agent and/or any ABL Secured Party, or any Additional ABL Agent and/or any Additional ABL Secured Party, receives an adequate protection Lien on post-petition assets of the debtor to secure the ABL Obligations or the Additional ABL Obligations, as the case may be, the Term Loan Agent also receives an adequate protection Lien on such post-petition assets of the debtor to secure the Term Loan Obligations and (iv)the terms of such DIP Financing do not require any Grantor to seek approval for any Plan of Reorganization that is not a Conforming Plan of Reorganization, provided that (x)such Liens in favor of the ABL Agent, any Additional ABL Agent and the Term Loan Agent shall be subject to the provisions of Section6.1(d) hereof and (y)the foregoing provisions of this Section6.1(a) shall not prevent the Term Loan Agent and the Term Loan Secured Parties from objecting to any provision in any DIP Financing relating to any provision or content of a Plan of Reorganization that is not a Conforming Plan of Reorganization.  
(b) If any Credit Party shall be subject to any Insolvency Proceeding in the United States at any time prior to the Discharge of ABL Collateral Obligations, and the ABL Agent or any ABL Credit Agreement Lenders, or any Additional ABL Agent or Additional ABL  
103  
 Credit Facility Lenders, shall agree to provide any Credit Party with, or consent to a third party providing, any DIP Financing, with such DIP Financing to be secured by all or any portion of the Collateral (including assets that, but for the application of Section552 of the Bankruptcy Code would be Collateral), then any Additional Term Agent, on behalf of itself and any Additional Term Secured Parties represented thereby, agrees that it will raise no objection, and will not directly or indirectly support, or act in concert with any other party in raising an objection, to such DIP Financing or to the Liens securing the same on the grounds of a failure to provide “adequate protection” for the Liens of such Additional Term Agent securing the Additional Term Obligations or on any other grounds (and will not request any adequate protection solely as a result of such DIP Financing), so long as (i)such Additional Term Agent retains its Lien on the Collateral to secure the Additional Term Obligations (in each case, including Proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code) and, as to the Term Loan Priority Collateral only, such Lien has the same priority as existed prior to the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code and any Lien securing such DIP Financing is junior and subordinate to the Lien of such Additional Term Agent on the Term Loan Priority Collateral (except as may be separately otherwise agreed in writing by and between such Additional Term Agent, on behalf of itself and the Additional Term Secured Parties represented thereby, and the ABL Agent, on behalf of itself and the ABL Secured Parties, or any Additional ABL Agent, on behalf of itself and the Additional ABL Secured Parties represented thereby), (ii)all Liens on ABL Priority Collateral securing any such DIP Financing shall be senior to or on a parity with the Liens of the ABL Agent and the ABL Secured Parties securing the ABL Obligations, and the Liens of any Additional ABL Agent and any Additional ABL Secured Parties securing the Additional ABL Obligations, on ABL Priority Collateral, (iii)if the ABL Agent and/or any ABL Secured Party, or any Additional ABL Agent and/or any Additional ABL Secured Party, receives an adequate protection Lien on post-petition assets of the debtor to secure the ABL Obligations or the Additional ABL Obligations, as the case may be, such Additional Term Agent also receives an adequate protection Lien on such post-petition assets of the debtor to secure the Additional Term Obligations and (iv)the terms of such DIP Financing do not require any Grantor to seek approval for any Plan of Reorganization that is not a Conforming Plan of Reorganization, provided that (x)such Liens in favor of the ABL Agent, any Additional ABL Agent and such Additional Term Agent shall be subject to the provisions of Section6.1(d) hereof and (y)the foregoing provisions of this Section6.1(b) shall not prevent any Additional Term Agent and any Additional Term Secured Parties from objecting to any provision in any DIP Financing relating to any provision or content of a Plan of Reorganization that is not a Conforming Plan of Reorganization.  
(c) [Reserved].  
(d) All Liens granted to the ABL Agent, the Term Loan Agent or any Additional Agent in any Insolvency Proceeding, whether as adequate protection or otherwise, are intended by the Parties to be and shall be deemed to be subject to the Lien Priority and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not alter the super-priority of any Liens securing any DIP Financing in accordance with this Section6.1.

In addition, none of the Term Loan Agent (including in its capacity as Term Loan Collateral Representative, if applicable), the ABL Agent (including in its capacity as ABL Collateral Representative, if applicable) nor any Additional Agent (including in its capacity as Term Loan Collateral Representative or ABL Collateral Representative, if and as applicable) shall seek any relief from the automatic stay with respect to any Collateral without providing 30 days’ prior written notice to each other Party, unless such period is agreed in writing by the ABL Agent, the Term Loan Agent and each Additional Agent to be modified.  
Section6.3 No Contest.

To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the ABL Secured Parties and the Additional ABL Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Term Loan Secured Parties and the Additional Term Secured Parties, on the other hand, in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then the ABL Secured Parties, the Term Loan Secured Parties, any Additional Term Secured Parties and any Additional ABL Secured Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of ABL Obligation claims, Additional ABL Obligation claims, Term Loan Obligation claims and Additional Term Obligation claims against the Credit Parties (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the ABL Priority Collateral or the Term Loan Priority Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the other Secured Parties), the ABL Secured Parties and the Additional ABL Secured Parties or the Term Loan Secured Parties and the Additional Term Secured Parties, respectively, shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in  
107  
 respect of post-petition interest that is available from each pool of Priority Collateral for each of the ABL Secured Parties and Additional ABL Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Term Loan Secured Parties and the Additional Term Secured Parties, on the other hand, before any distribution is made from the applicable pool of Priority Collateral in respect of the claims held by the other Secured Parties, with the other Secured Parties hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the respective other Secured Parties amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the applicable pool of Priority Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the aggregate recoveries. The foregoing sentence is subject to any separate agreement by and between any Additional Agent, on behalf of itself and the Additional Secured Parties represented thereby, and any other Additional Agent, on behalf of itself and the Additional Secured Parties represented thereby, with respect to the Additional Obligations owing to any of such Additional Agent and Additional Secured Parties.

108  
(ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any portion of the Term Loan Obligations, or any amendment, waiver or other modification, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, or any refinancing, replacement, refunding or restatement of any Term Loan Document;

109  
(b) in the event that the ABL Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the ABL Secured Parties, seeks or requests adequate protection in respect of the ABL Obligations and such adequate protection is granted in the form of a Lien on additional collateral comprising assets of the type of assets that constitute Term Loan Priority Collateral, then the ABL Agent, on behalf of itself and each of the ABL Secured Parties, agrees that any Additional Term Agent shall also be granted a senior Lien on such collateral as security for the Additional Term Obligations and that any Lien on such collateral securing the ABL Obligations shall be subordinate to any Lien on such collateral securing the Additional Term Obligations (except as may be separately otherwise agreed in writing by and between such Additional Term Agent, on behalf of itself and the Additional Term Secured Parties represented thereby, and the ABL Agent, on behalf of itself and the ABL Secured Parties),

Section7.19 No Warranties or Liability. The Term Loan Agent, the ABL Agent and any Additional Agent each acknowledges and agrees that none of the other Parties has made any representation or warranty with respect to the execution, validity, legality, completeness, collectability or enforceability of any other ABL Document, any other Term Loan Document or any other Additional Document.

Section7.22 Excluded Property. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement (including Sections2.1, 2.5, 4.1, 6.1 and 6.9 hereof) shall be deemed to provide or require that any Agent or any Secured Party represented thereby receive any Proceeds of, or any Lien on, any Property of any Credit Party that constitutes “Excluded Property” under (and as defined in) the applicable Credit Facility or any related Credit Document to which such Agent is a party.

Section2.4 Exercise of Rights.  
(a) No Other Restrictions. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, each Agent and each Creditor shall have any and all rights and remedies it may have as a creditor under applicable law, including the right to the Exercise of Secured Creditor Remedies (except as may be separately otherwise agreed in writing by and between or among any applicable Parties, solely as among such Parties and the Creditors represented thereby); provided, however, that the Exercise of Secured Creditor Remedies with respect to the Collateral shall be subject to the Lien Priority and to the provisions of this Agreement, including Section4.1.

L-28  
 hereunder or under any of the applicable Junior Priority Documents. Each Agent agrees for and on behalf of itself and each Creditor represented thereby that such Agent and each such Creditor will not institute or join in any suit, Insolvency Proceeding or other proceeding or assert in any suit or other proceeding any claim, (x)in the case of any Junior Priority Agent and any Junior Priority Creditor represented thereby, against any Senior Priority Secured Party, and (y)in the case of any Senior Priority Agent and any Senior Priority Creditor represented thereby, against any Junior Priority Secured Party, seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise, with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by such Person with respect to the Collateral that is consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and none of such Persons shall be liable for any such action taken or omitted to be taken.

In furtherance of, and subject to, the foregoing, each Junior Priority Agent agrees that it will execute any and all Lien releases or other documents reasonably requested by any Senior Priority Agent in connection therewith, so long as the net cash proceeds, if any, from such sale described in clause(A) above of such Collateral are applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section2.6 Waiver of Marshalling. Until the Discharge of Senior Priority Obligations, each Junior Priority Agent (including in its capacity as Junior Priority Representative, if applicable), on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Secured Parties represented thereby, agrees not to assert and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to demand, request, plead or otherwise assert or otherwise claim the benefit of, any marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may otherwise be available under applicable law with respect to the Collateral or any other similar rights a junior secured creditor may have under applicable law.

In the event of any Impairment of Series of Junior Priority Debt with respect to any Series of Junior Priority Debt, the results of such Impairment of Series of Junior Priority Debt shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of Junior Priority Debt, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Junior Priority Debt (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Junior Priority Debt pursuant to Section4.1) set forth herein shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment of Series of Junior Priority Debt are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such Junior Priority Debt subject to such Impairment.  
(j) Junior Intervening Creditor. Notwithstanding anything in Section4.1(b) to the contrary, solely as among the Junior Priority Secured Parties with respect to any Collateral for which a third party (other than a Junior Priority Secured Party) has a Lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the Lien or security interest of any Series of Junior Priority Debt but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the Lien or security interest of any other Series of Junior Priority Debt (such third party, a “Junior Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Collateral or Proceeds that are allocated to such third party shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Collateral or Proceeds thereof to be distributed in respect of the Series of Junior Priority Debt with respect to which such Impairment of Series of Junior Priority Debt exists.  
Section4.2 Specific Performance. Each Agent is hereby authorized to demand specific performance of this Agreement, whether or not any Credit Party shall have complied with any of  
L-37  
 the provisions of any of the Credit Documents, at any time when any other Party shall have failed to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to it. Each Agent, for and on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties represented thereby, hereby irrevocably waives any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law that might be asserted as a bar to such remedy of specific performance.

Each Junior Priority Agent, on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that no Senior Priority Agent or Senior Priority Creditor shall incur any liability as a result of a sale, lease, license, application, or other disposition of all  
L-38

(i) change the manner, place, time, or terms of payment or renew, alter or increase, all or any of the Junior Priority Obligations or otherwise amend, restate, supplement, or otherwise modify in any manner, or grant any waiver or release with respect to, all or any part of the Junior Priority Obligations or any of the Junior Priority Documents;

L-42  
 Creditors, as the case may be, all without affecting the Lien Priorities provided for herein or the other provisions hereof; provided, however, that (x)if the Indebtedness refunding, replacing or refinancing any such Senior Priority Obligations or Junior Priority Obligations is to constitute Senior Priority Obligations or Junior Priority Obligations hereunder (as designated by the Company), the holders of such Indebtedness (or an authorized agent or trustee on their behalf) shall bind themselves in writing to the terms of this Agreement pursuant to an Additional Indebtedness Joinder and any such refunding, replacement or refinancing transaction shall be in accordance with any applicable provisions of the Senior Priority Documents and the Junior Priority Documents and (y)for the avoidance of doubt, the Senior Priority Obligations and Junior Priority Obligations may be refunded, replaced or refinanced, in whole or in part, in each case, without notice to, or the consent (except to the extent a consent is required to permit the refunding, replacement or refinancing transaction under any Senior Priority Document or any Junior Priority Document) of any Senior Priority Agent, Senior Priority Creditors, Junior Priority Agent or Junior Priority Creditors, as the case may be, through the incurrence of Additional Indebtedness, subject to Section7.11 hereof and, if applicable, Section7.11 of the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement.  
Section5.3 Reinstatement and Continuation of Agreement. If any Senior Priority Agent or Senior Priority Creditor is required in any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of any Credit Party or any other Person any payment made in satisfaction of all or any portion of the Senior Priority Obligations (a “Senior Priority Recovery”), then the Senior Priority Obligations shall be reinstated to the extent of such Senior Priority Recovery. In the event that (a)this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Senior Priority Recovery and (b)there exists any Junior Priority Obligations at the time of such Senior Priority Recovery, then this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect in the event of such Senior Priority Recovery, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair, or otherwise affect the obligations of the Parties from such date of reinstatement. All rights, interests, agreements, and obligations of each Agent, each Senior Priority Creditor, and each Junior Priority Creditor under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall continue irrespective of the commencement of, or any discharge, confirmation, conversion, or dismissal of, any Insolvency Proceeding by or against any Credit Party or any other circumstance which otherwise might constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Credit Party in respect of the Senior Priority Obligations or the Junior Priority Obligations. No priority or right of any Senior Priority Agent or any Senior Priority Creditor shall at any time be prejudiced or impaired in any way by any act or failure to act on the part of any Borrower or any Guarantor or by the noncompliance by any Person with the terms, provisions, or covenants of any of the Senior Priority Documents, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any Senior Priority Agent or any Senior Priority Creditor may have.  
ARTICLE VI  
INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS  
Section6.1 DIP Financing.  
(a) If any Credit Party shall be subject to any Insolvency Proceeding in the United States at any time prior to the Discharge of Senior Priority Obligations, and any Senior  
L-43  
 Priority Agent or Senior Priority Creditors shall seek to provide any Credit Party with, or consent to a third party providing, any financing under Section364 of the Bankruptcy Code or consent to any order for the use of cash collateral under Section363 of the Bankruptcy Code (“DIP Financing”), with such DIP Financing to be secured by all or any portion of the Collateral (including assets that, but for the application of Section552 of the Bankruptcy Code would be Collateral), then each Junior Priority Agent, for and on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that it will raise no objection and will not directly or indirectly support or act in concert with any other party in raising an objection to such DIP Financing or to the Liens securing the same on the grounds of a failure to provide “adequate protection” for the Liens of such Junior Priority Agent securing the applicable Junior Priority Obligations or on any other grounds (and will not request any adequate protection solely as a result of such DIP Financing, except as otherwise set forth herein), and, to the extent Liens securing Senior Priority Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with the Liens securing such DIP Financing, will subordinate its Liens on the Collateral to (i)the Liens securing such DIP Financing (and to all obligations relating thereto), (ii)any adequate protection liens provided to the Senior Priority Creditors, and (iii)any “carve out” for professional or United States Trustee fees agreed to by the Senior Priority Representative, so long as (x)such Junior Priority Agent retains its Lien on the Collateral to secure the applicable Junior Priority Obligations (in each case, including Proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code), (y)all Liens on Collateral securing any such DIP Financing are senior to or on a parity with the Liens of the Senior Priority Agents and the Senior Priority Creditors on the Collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations and (z)if any Senior Priority Agent receives an adequate protection Lien on post-petition assets of the debtor to secure the Senior Priority Obligations, each Junior Priority Agent also receives an adequate protection Lien on such post-petition assets of the debtor to secure the related Junior Priority Obligations, provided that (x)such Liens in favor of such Senior Priority Agent and such Junior Priority Agent shall be subject to the provisions of Section6.1(b) hereof and the relevant provisions of Section6.1 of the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement and (y)the foregoing provisions of this Section6.1(a) shall not prevent any Junior Priority Agent or Junior Priority Creditor from objecting to any provision in any DIP Financing relating to any provision or content of a plan of reorganization.  
(b) All Liens granted to any Senior Priority Agent or Junior Priority Agent in any Insolvency Proceeding, whether as adequate protection or otherwise, are intended by the Parties to be and shall be deemed to be subject to the Lien Priority and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not alter the super-priority of any Liens securing any DIP Financing.  
Section6.2 Relief from Stay. Until the Discharge of Senior Priority Obligations, each Junior Priority Agent, for and on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees not to seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency Proceeding in respect of any portion of the Collateral without each Senior Priority Agent’s express written consent.  
Section6.3 No Contest. Each Junior Priority Agent, for and on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that, prior to the Discharge of Senior Priority Obligations, none of them shall contest (or directly or indirectly support any other Person contesting) (i)any request by any Senior Priority Agent or Senior Priority Creditor for  
L-44  
 adequate protection of its interest in the Collateral (unless in contravention of Section6.1(a)), or (ii)any objection by any Senior Priority Agent or Senior Priority Creditor to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim by such Senior Priority Agent or Senior Priority Creditor that its interests in the Collateral (unless in contravention of Section6.1(a)) are not adequately protected (or any other similar request under any law applicable to an Insolvency Proceeding), so long as any Liens granted to such Senior Priority Agent as adequate protection of its interests are subject to this Agreement. Except as may be separately otherwise agreed in writing by and between or among any applicable Senior Priority Agents, in each case on behalf of itself and any Senior Priority Creditors represented thereby, any Senior Priority Agent, for and on behalf of itself and any Senior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that, prior to the applicable Discharge of Senior Priority Obligations, none of them shall contest (or directly or indirectly support any other Person contesting) (a)any request by any other Senior Priority Agent or any Senior Priority Creditor represented by such other Senior Priority Agent for adequate protection of its interest in the Collateral, or (b)any objection by such other Senior Priority Agent or any Senior Priority Creditor to any motion, relief, action, or proceeding based on a claim by such other Senior Priority Agent or any Senior Priority Creditor represented by such other Senior Priority Agent that its interests in the Collateral are not adequately protected (or any other similar request under any law applicable to an Insolvency Proceeding), so long as any Liens granted to such other Senior Priority Agent as adequate protection of its interests are subject to this Agreement. Except as may be separately otherwise agreed in writing by and between or among any applicable Junior Priority Agents, in each case on behalf of itself and any Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, any Junior Priority Agent, for and on behalf of itself and any Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that, prior to the applicable Discharge of Junior Priority Obligations, none of them shall contest (or directly or indirectly support any other Person contesting) (a)any request by any other Junior Priority Agent or any Junior Priority Creditor represented by such other Junior Priority Agent for adequate protection of its interest in the Collateral, or (b)any objection by such other Junior Priority Agent or any Junior Priority Creditor to any motion, relief, action, or proceeding based on a claim by such other Junior Priority Agent or any Junior Priority Creditor represented by such other Junior Priority Agent that its interests in the Collateral are not adequately protected (or any other similar request under any law applicable to an Insolvency Proceeding), so long as any Liens granted to such other Junior Priority Agent as adequate protection of its interests are subject to this Agreement.  
Section6.4 Asset Sales. Each Junior Priority Agent agrees, for and on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, that it will not oppose any sale consented to by any Senior Priority Agent of any Collateral pursuant to Section363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under the law applicable to any Insolvency Proceeding) so long as the proceeds of such sale are applied in accordance with this Agreement and the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement.  
Section6.5 Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classification. Each Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that (i)the grants of Liens pursuant to the Senior Priority Collateral Documents and the Junior Priority Collateral Documents constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (ii)because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Senior Priority Obligations are fundamentally different from the Junior Priority Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization proposed or adopted in an Insolvency Proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the  
L-45  
 immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the Senior Priority Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Junior Priority Secured Parties, on the other hand, in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then each Agent hereby acknowledges and agrees, for and on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties represented thereby, that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of Senior Priority Obligation claims and Junior Priority Obligation claims against the Credit Parties, with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior Priority Secured Parties), the Senior Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest that is available from the Collateral for each of the Senior Priority Secured Parties, before any distribution from the Collateral is made in respect of the claims held by the Junior Priority Secured Parties, with the Junior Priority Secured Parties hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Senior Priority Secured Parties amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing their aggregate recoveries. The foregoing sentence is subject to any separate agreement by and between any Additional Agent, on behalf of itself and the Additional Creditors represented thereby, and any other Agent, on behalf of itself and the Creditors represented thereby, with respect to the Obligations owing to any such Additional Agent and Additional Creditors.  
Section6.6 Enforceability. The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be and shall be enforceable as a “subordination agreement” under Section510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.  
Section6.7 Senior Priority Obligations Unconditional. All rights of any Senior Priority Agent hereunder, and all agreements and obligations of the other Senior Priority Agents, the Junior Priority Agents and the Credit Parties (to the extent applicable) hereunder, shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:  
(a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Senior Priority Document;  
(b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any portion of the Senior Priority Obligations, or any amendment, waiver or other modification, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, or any refinancing, replacement, refunding or restatement of any Senior Priority Document;  
(c) any exchange, release, voiding, avoidance or non-perfection of any security interest in any Collateral or any other collateral, or any release, amendment, waiver or other modification, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, or any refinancing, replacement, refunding, restatement or increase of all or any portion of the Senior Priority Obligations or any guarantee or guaranty thereof;  
(d) the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding in respect of the Company or any other Credit Party; or  
(e) any other circumstances that otherwise might constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Credit Party in respect of the Senior Priority Obligations, or of any of the Junior Priority Agent or any Credit Party, to the extent applicable, in respect of this Agreement.  
L-46  
Section6.8 Junior Priority Obligations Unconditional. All rights of any Junior Priority Agent hereunder, and all agreements and obligations of the Senior Priority Agents, the other Junior Priority Agents and the Credit Parties (to the extent applicable) hereunder, shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:  
(a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Junior Priority Document;  
(b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any portion of the Junior Priority Obligations, or any amendment, waiver or other modification, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, or any refinancing, replacement, refunding or restatement of any Junior Priority Document;  
(c) any exchange, release, voiding, avoidance or non-perfection of any security interest in any Collateral, or any other collateral, or any release, amendment, waiver or other modification, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, or any refinancing, replacement, refunding, restatement or increase of all or any portion of the Junior Priority Obligations or any guarantee or guaranty thereof;  
(d) the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding in respect of any Credit Party; or  
(e) any other circumstances that otherwise might constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Credit Party in respect of the Junior Priority Obligations, or of any of the Senior Priority Agent or any Credit Party, to the extent applicable, in respect of this Agreement.  
Section6.9 Adequate Protection. Except to the extent expressly provided in Section6.1 and this Section6.9, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights of any Agent and the Secured Parties represented thereby from seeking or requesting adequate protection with respect to their interests in the applicable Collateral in any Insolvency Proceeding, including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment, periodic cash payments, cash payments of interest, additional collateral or otherwise; provided that (a)in the event that any Junior Priority Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, seeks or requests adequate protection in respect of the Junior Priority Obligations and such adequate protection is granted in the form of a Lien on additional collateral comprising assets of the type of assets that constitute Collateral, then each Junior Priority Agent, on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that (i)each Senior Priority Agent shall also be granted a senior Lien on such collateral as security for the Senior Priority Obligations and that any Lien on such collateral securing the Junior Priority Obligations shall be subordinate to any Lien on such collateral securing the Senior Priority Obligations and (ii)each other Junior Priority Agent shall also be granted a pari passu Lien on such collateral as security for the Junior Priority Obligations owing to such other Junior Priority Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties represented  
L-47  
 thereby, and that any such Lien on such collateral securing such Junior Priority Obligations shall be pari passu to each other Lien on such collateral securing such other Junior Priority Obligations (except as may be separately agreed in writing by and between or among any applicable Junior Priority Agents, in each case on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Secured Parties represented thereby); and (b)in the event that any Senior Priority Agent, for or on behalf of itself or any Senior Priority Creditor represented thereby, seeks or requests adequate protection in respect of the Senior Priority Obligations and such adequate protection is granted in the form of a Lien on additional collateral comprising assets of the type of assets that constitute Collateral, then such Senior Priority Agent, for and on behalf of itself and the Senior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that (i)each other Senior Priority Agent shall also be granted a pari passu Lien on such collateral as security for the Senior Priority Obligations owing to such other Senior Priority Agent and the Senior Priority Secured Parties represented thereby, and that any such Lien on such collateral securing such Senior Priority Obligations shall be pari passu to each such other Lien on such collateral securing such other Senior Priority Obligations (except as may be separately otherwise agreed in writing by and between or among any applicable Senior Priority Agents, in each case on behalf of itself and the Senior Priority Secured Parties represented thereby) and (ii)each Junior Priority Agent shall also be granted a junior Lien on such collateral as security for the Junior Priority Obligations owing to such other Junior Priority Agent and the Junior Priority Secured Parties represented thereby, and that any such Lien on such collateral securing such Junior Priority Obligations shall be junior to each Lien on such collateral securing Senior Priority Obligations.  
Section6.10 Reorganization Securities and Other Plan-Related Issues.  
(a) If, in any Insolvency Proceeding, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, on account of claims of the Senior Priority Creditors and/or on account of claims of the Junior Priority Creditors, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of claims of the Senior Priority Creditors and/or on account of claims of the Junior Priority Creditors are secured by Liens upon the same property, the provisions of this Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations.  
(b) Each Junior Priority Agent and the other Junior Priority Creditors (whether in the capacity of a secured creditor or an unsecured creditor) shall not propose, vote in favor of, or otherwise directly or indirectly support any plan of reorganization that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of this Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Senior Priority Agents or to the extent any such plan is proposed or supported by the number of Senior Priority Creditors required under Section1126(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.  
(c) Each Senior Priority Agent and the other Senior Priority Creditors (whether in the capacity of a secured creditor or an unsecured creditor) shall not propose, vote in favor of, or otherwise directly or indirectly support any plan of reorganization that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of this Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of each other Senior Priority Agent.  
L-48

Section7.1 Rights of Subrogation. Each Junior Priority Agent, for and on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that no payment by such Junior Priority Agent or any such Junior Priority Creditor to any Senior Priority Agent or Senior Priority Creditor pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall entitle such Junior Priority Agent or Junior Priority Creditor to exercise any rights of subrogation in respect thereof until the Discharge of Senior Priority Obligations shall have occurred. Following the Discharge of Senior Priority Obligations, each Senior Priority Agent agrees to execute such documents, agreements, and instruments as any Junior Priority Agent or Junior Priority Creditor may reasonably request to evidence the transfer by subrogation to any such Person of an interest in the Senior Priority Obligations resulting from payments to such Senior Priority Agent by such Person, so long as all costs and expenses (including all reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred in connection therewith by such Senior Priority Agent are paid by such Person upon request for payment thereof.

L-49  
 reasonably request, in order to protect any right or interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable such Party to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder; provided, however, that no Party shall be required to pay over any payment or distribution, execute any instruments or documents, or take any other action referred to in this Section7.2, to the extent that such action would contravene any law, order or other legal requirement or any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and in the event of a controversy or dispute, such Party may interplead any payment or distribution in any court of competent jurisdiction, without further responsibility in respect of such payment or distribution under this Section7.2.

Section7.4 Amendments.  
(a) No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Party hereto, shall be effective unless it is in a written agreement executed by (i)prior to the Discharge of Original First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Agent, (ii)prior to the Discharge of Original Second Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Agent and (iii)prior to the Discharge of Additional Obligations in respect of any Additional Credit Facilities, the applicable Additional Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, without the consent of any Party hereto, amend this Agreement to add an Additional Agent by (x)executing an Additional Indebtedness Joinder as provided in Section7.11 or (y)executing a joinder agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto as provided for in the definition of “Original First Lien Credit Agreement” or “Original Second Lien Credit Agreement”, as applicable. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure therefrom by any Party hereto, that changes, alters, modifies or otherwise affects any power, privilege, right, remedy, liability or obligation of, or otherwise adversely affects in any manner, any Additional Agent that is not then a Party, or any Additional Creditor not then represented by an Additional Agent that is then a Party (including but not limited to any change, alteration, modification or other effect upon any power, privilege, right, remedy, liability or obligation of or other adverse effect upon any such Additional Agent or Additional Creditor that may at any subsequent time become a Party or beneficiary hereof) shall be effective unless it is consented to in writing by the Company (regardless of whether any such Additional Agent or Additional Creditor ever becomes a Party or beneficiary hereof). Any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement that would have the effect, directly or indirectly, through any reference in any Credit Document to this Agreement or otherwise, of waiving, amending, supplementing or otherwise modifying such Credit Document, or any term or provision thereof, or any right or obligation of any Credit Party thereunder or in respect thereof, shall not be given such effect except pursuant to a written instrument executed  
L-50  
 by the Company and each other affected Credit Party. Any amendment, modification or waiver of clause (b)in any of the definitions of the terms “Additional Credit Facilities,” “Original First Lien Credit Agreement” and “Original Second Lien Credit Agreement” shall not be given effect except pursuant to a written instrument executed by the Company.  
(b) In the event that any Senior Priority Agent or the requisite Senior Priority Creditors enter into any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of or replace any Senior Priority Collateral Document for the purpose of adding to, or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures from any provisions of, any Senior Priority Collateral Document relating to the Collateral or changing in any manner the rights of any Senior Priority Agent, the Senior Priority Creditors represented thereby, or any Credit Party with respect to the Collateral (including the release of any Liens on Collateral), then such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any comparable provision of each Junior Priority Collateral Document without the consent of or any actions by any Junior Priority Agent or any Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby; provided, that (i)no such amendment, waiver or consent shall have the effect of removing assets subject to the Lien of any Junior Priority Collateral Document, except to the extent that a release of such Lien is permitted by the terms hereof, or (ii)such amendment, waiver or consent does not materially adversely affect the rights or interests of such Junior Priority Creditors in the Collateral. The applicable Senior Priority Agent shall, at the Company’s request and expense, give written notice of such amendment, waiver or consent to the Junior Priority Agents; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or consent with respect to the provisions of any Junior Priority Collateral Document as set forth in this Section7.4(b).

The Senior Priority Secured Parties and the Junior Priority Secured Parties may continue, at any time and without notice to the other Parties hereto, to extend credit and other financial accommodations, lend monies and provide Indebtedness to, or for the benefit of, any Credit Party on the faith hereof.  
Section7.8 Governing Law; Entire Agreement. The validity, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements, written or oral, with respect thereto (it being understood that this Agreement does not supersede the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Initial Original First Lien Credit Agreement).  
Section7.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and it is not necessary that the signatures of all Parties be contained on any one counterpart hereof; each counterpart will be deemed to be an original, and all together shall constitute one and the same document.  
Section7.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the rights and benefits hereof shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and its respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of each of the Senior Priority Agents, the Senior Priority Creditors, the Junior Priority Agents, the Junior Priority Creditors and, except for purposes of Sections 2.4(b), 5.2, 7.4 and 7.11 hereof and Sections 2.4(f), 5.2, 7.4 and 7.11 of the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement, the Company and the other Credit Parties. No other Person shall have or be entitled to assert rights or benefits hereunder.  
Section7.11 Designation of Additional Indebtedness; Joinder of Additional Agents.  
(a) The Company may designate any Additional Indebtedness complying with the requirements of the definition thereof as Additional Indebtedness for purposes of this Agreement, upon complying with the following conditions:  
(i) one or more Additional Agents for one or more Additional Creditors in respect of such Additional Indebtedness shall have executed the Additional Indebtedness Joinder with respect to such Additional Indebtedness, and the Company or any such Additional Agent shall have delivered such executed Additional Indebtedness Joinder to the Original First Lien Agent, the Original Second Lien Agent and any other Additional Agent then party to this Agreement;  
(ii) a reasonable period of time prior to delivery of the Additional Indebtedness Joinder, the Company shall have delivered to the Original First Lien Agent, the Original Second Lien Agent and any other Additional Agent then party to this Agreement complete and correct copies of any Additional Credit Facility, Additional Guaranties and Additional Collateral Documents that will govern such Additional  
L-53  
 Indebtedness upon giving effect to such designation (which may be unexecuted copies of Additional Documents to be executed and delivered concurrently with the effectiveness of such designation);  
(iii) the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Original First Lien Agent, the Original Second Lien Agent and any other Additional Agent then party to this Agreement the Additional Indebtedness Designation (including whether such Additional Indebtedness is designated Senior Priority Debt or Junior Priority Debt) with respect to such Additional Indebtedness; and  
(iv) all state and local stamp, recording, filing, intangible and similar taxes or fees (if any) that are payable in connection with the inclusion of such Additional Indebtedness under this Agreement shall have been paid and reasonable evidence thereof shall have been given to the Original First Lien Agent, the Original Second Lien Agent and any other Additional Agent then party to this Agreement.  
No Additional Indebtedness may be designated both Senior Priority Debt and Junior Priority Debt.  
(b) Upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the preceding Section7.11(a), the designated Additional Indebtedness shall constitute “Additional Indebtedness”, any Additional Credit Facility under which such Additional Indebtedness is or may be incurred shall constitute an “Additional Credit Facility”, any holder of such Additional Indebtedness or other applicable Additional Creditor shall constitute an “Additional Creditor”, and any Additional Agent for any such Additional Creditor shall constitute an “Additional Agent” for all purposes under this Agreement. The date on which such conditions specified in clause (a)shall have been satisfied with respect to any Additional Indebtedness is herein called the “Additional Effective Date” with respect to such Additional Indebtedness. Prior to the Additional Effective Date with respect to any Additional Indebtedness, all references herein to Additional Indebtedness shall be deemed not to take into account such Additional Indebtedness, and the rights and obligations of the Original First Lien Agent, the Original Second Lien Agent and each other Additional Agent then party to this Agreement shall be determined on the basis that such Additional Indebtedness is not then designated. On and after the Additional Effective Date with respect to such Additional Indebtedness, all references herein to Additional Indebtedness shall be deemed to take into account such Additional Indebtedness, and the rights and obligations of the Original First Lien Agent, the Original Second Lien Agent and each other Additional Agent then party to this Agreement shall be determined on the basis that such Additional Indebtedness is then designated.  
(c) In connection with any designation of Additional Indebtedness pursuant to this Section7.11, each of the Original First Lien Agent, the Original Second Lien Agent and each Additional Agent then party hereto agrees (x)to execute and deliver any amendments, amendments and restatements, restatements or waivers of or supplements to or other modifications to, any Original First Lien Collateral Documents, Original Second Lien Collateral Documents or Additional Collateral Documents, as applicable, and any agreements relating to any security interest in Control Collateral and Cash Collateral, and to make or consent to any filings or take any other actions (including executing and recording any mortgage subordination  
L-54  
 or similar agreement), as may be reasonably deemed by the Company to be necessary or reasonably desirable for any Lien on any Collateral to secure such Additional Indebtedness to become a valid and perfected Lien (with the priority contemplated by the applicable Additional Indebtedness Designation delivered pursuant to this Section7.11 and by this Agreement), and (y)otherwise to reasonably cooperate to effectuate a designation of Additional Indebtedness pursuant to this Section7.11 (including, without limitation, if requested, by executing an acknowledgment of any Additional Indebtedness Joinder or of the occurrence of any Additional Effective Date).  
Section7.12 Senior Priority Representative; Notice of Senior Priority Representative Change. The Senior Priority Representative shall act for the Senior Priority Secured Parties as provided in this Agreement, and shall be entitled to so act at the direction or with the consent of the Controlling Senior Priority Secured Parties, or of the requisite percentage of such Controlling Senior Priority Secured Parties as provided in the applicable Senior Priority Documents (or the agent or representative with respect thereto). Until a Party (other than the existing Senior Priority Representative) receives written notice from the existing Senior Priority Representative, in accordance with Section7.5, of a change in the identity of the Senior Priority Representative, such Party shall be entitled to act as if the existing Senior Priority Representative is in fact the Senior Priority Representative. Each Party (other than the existing Senior Priority Representative) shall be entitled to rely upon any written notice of a change in the identity of the Senior Priority Representative which facially appears to be from the then existing Senior Priority Representative and is delivered in accordance with Section7.5 and such Agent shall not be required to inquire into the veracity or genuineness of such notice. Each existing Senior Priority Representative from time to time agrees at the Company’s request and expense to give prompt written notice to each Party of any change in the identity of the Senior Priority Representative.  
Section7.13 Term Loan Collateral Representative. Each Junior Priority Agent, on behalf of itself and the Junior Priority Creditors represented thereby, agrees that prior to the Discharge of the Senior Priority Obligations, (x)such Junior Priority Agent shall be ineligible to act as the “Term Loan Collateral Representative” under the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement and shall not act in such capacity, and for purposes of determining the “Term Loan Collateral Representative” under the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement the Additional Term Obligations (as defined in the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement) of such Junior Priority Creditors shall be disregarded and deemed not Additional Term Obligations (as defined in the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement), (y)such Junior Priority Creditors shall be ineligible to vote on matters requiring the consent or approval of the “Requisite Term Loan Holders” under the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement and (z)the Additional Term Obligations (as defined in the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement) of such Junior Priority Creditors shall be disregarded and deemed not outstanding for purposes of calculating “Requisite Term Loan Holders” under the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement.  
Section7.14 Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights. The provisions of this Agreement are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Senior Priority Secured Parties and the Junior Priority Secured Parties, respectively. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair the rights of any Credit Party, or the obligations of any Credit Party to pay the Original First Lien Obligations, the Original Second Lien Obligations and any Additional Obligations as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms.  
L-55  
Section7.15 Headings. The headings of the articles and sections of this Agreement are inserted for purposes of convenience only and shall not be construed to affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof.  
Section7.16 Severability. If any of the provisions in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and shall not invalidate the Lien Priority or the application of Proceeds and other priorities set forth in this Agreement.  
Section7.17 Attorneys’ Fees. The Parties agree that if any dispute, arbitration, litigation, or other proceeding is brought with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement or any provision hereof, the prevailing party in such dispute, arbitration, litigation, or other proceeding shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and all other costs and expenses incurred in the enforcement of this Agreement, irrespective of whether suit is brought.  
Section7.18 VENUE; JURY TRIAL WAIVER.  
(a) EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE GENERAL JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK (THE “NEW YORK SUPREME COURT”), AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (THE “FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT,” AND TOGETHER WITH THE NEW YORK SUPREME COURT, THE “NEW YORK COURTS”) AND APPELLATE COURTS FROM EITHER OF THEM AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN SUCH NEW YORK COURTS; PROVIDED THAT NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED OR OPERATE TO PRECLUDE (I)ANY AGENT FROM BRINGING SUIT OR TAKING OTHER LEGAL ACTION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION TO REALIZE ON THE COLLATERAL OR ANY OTHER SECURITY FOR THE OBLIGATIONS, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF ANY AGENT, (II)ANY PARTY FROM BRINGING ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION FOR THE RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, (III) IF ALL SUCH NEW YORK COURTS DECLINE JURISDICTION OVER ANY PERSON, OR DECLINE (OR, IN THE CASE OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT, LACK) JURISDICTION OVER ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, A LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE BROUGHT WITH RESPECT THERETO IN ANOTHER COURT HAVING JURISDICTION AND (IV) IN THE EVENT A LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT AGAINST ANY PARTY HERETO OR INVOLVING ANY OF ITS ASSETS OR PROPERTY IN ANOTHER COURT (WITHOUT ANY COLLUSIVE ASSISTANCE BY SUCH PARTY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES), SUCH PARTY FROM ASSERTING A CLAIM OR DEFENSE (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR DEFENSE THAT THIS SECTION 7.18 WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE TO BE ASSERTED IN A LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN A NEW YORK COURT) IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING  
L-56  
(b) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 7.18(b) WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  
(c) EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 7.5. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW  
Section7.19 Intercreditor Agreement. This Agreement is the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement referred to in the Initial Original First Lien Credit Agreement, the Original Second Lien Credit Agreement and each Additional Credit Facility. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to subordinate the right of any Junior Priority Secured Party to receive payment to the right of any Senior Priority Secured Party (whether before or after the occurrence of an Insolvency Proceeding), it being the intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall effectuate a subordination of Liens as between the Senior Priority Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Junior Priority Secured Parties, on the other hand, but not a subordination of Indebtedness.  
Section7.20 No Warranties or Liability. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that none of the other Parties has made any representation or warranty with respect to the execution, validity, legality, completeness, collectability or enforceability of any other Term Loan Document, any other Original Second Lien Facility Documentation or any other Additional Document. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party will be entitled to manage and supervise its respective extensions of credit to any Credit Party in accordance with law and their usual practices, modified from time to time as they deem appropriate.  
Section7.21 Conflicts. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of any Original First Lien Facility Documentation, any Original Second Lien Facility Documentation or any Additional Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any conflict between the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the provisions of the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement shall control; provided, however, that as permitted by the ABL/Term Intercreditor Agreement this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate writing altering the rights between the Senior Priority Creditors on the one hand and the Junior Priority Creditors on  
L-57  
 the other hand. The parties hereto acknowledge that the terms of this Agreement are not intended to negate any specific rights granted to, or obligations of, the Company or any other Credit Party in the Original First Lien Facility Documentation, the Original Second Lien Facility Documentation or any Additional Documents.  
Section7.22 Information Concerning Financial Condition of the Credit Parties. No Party has any responsibility for keeping any other Party informed of the financial condition of the Credit Parties or of other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Original First Lien Obligations, the Original Second Lien Obligations or any Additional Obligations, as applicable. Each Party hereby agrees that no Party shall have any duty to advise any other Party of information known to it regarding such condition or any such circumstances. In the event any Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any information to any other Party to this Agreement, it shall be under no obligation (a)to provide any such information to such other Party or any other Party on any subsequent occasion, (b)to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, or (c)to disclose any other information.  
Section7.23 Excluded Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement (including Sections 2.1, 4.1, 6.1 and 6.9) shall be deemed to provide or require that any Agent or any Secured Party represented thereby receive any Proceeds of, or any Lien on, any Property of any Credit Party that constitutes “Excluded Property” (other than set forth in clause (a)of definition thereof) or “Excluded Equity Interests” under (and as defined in) the applicable Credit Document to which such Agent is a party.
